    "abstract": "The present study aimed to investigate the protective effects of rAAV9-CyclinA2 combined with fibrin glue (FG) in vivo in rats after myocardial infarction (MI). Ninety male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into 6 groups (15 in each group): sham, MI, rAAV9-green fluorescent protein (GFP) + MI, rAAV9-CyclinA2 + MI, FG + MI, and rAAV9-CyclinA2 + FG + MI. Packed virus (5 x 10<sup>11</sup>vg/ml) in 150 micro l of normal saline or FG was injected into the infarcted myocardium at five locations in rAAV9-GFP + MI, rAAV9-CyclinA2 + MI, and rAAV9-CyclinA2 + FG + MI groups. The sham, MI, and FG + MI groups were injected with an equal volume of normal saline or FG at the same sites. Five weeks after injection, echocardiography was performed to evaluate the left ventricular function. The expressions of CyclinA2, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and phospho-histone-H3 (H3P), vascular density, and infarct area were assessed by Western blot, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and Masson staining. As a result, the combination of rAAV9-CyclinA2 and FG increased ejection fraction and fractional shortening compared with FG or rAAV9-CyclinA2 alone. The expression level of CyclinA2 was significantly higher in the rAAV9-CyclinA2 + FG + MI group compared with the rAAV9-CyclinA2 + MI and FG + MI groups (70.1 +/- 1.86% vs. 14.74 +/- 2.02%, P < 0.01; or vs. 50.13 +/- 3.80%; P < 0.01). A higher expression level of PCNA and H3P was found in the rAAV9-CyclinA2 + FG + MI group compared with other groups. Comparing with other experiment groups, collagen deposition and the infarct size significantly decreased in rAAV9-CyclinA2 + Fibrin + MI group. The vascular density was much higher in the rAAV9-CyclinA2 + FG + MI group compared with the rAAV9-CyclinA2 + MI group. We concluded that fibrin glue combined with rAAV9-CyclinA2 was found to be effective in cardiac remodeling and improving myocardial protection.\nCopyright \u00a9 2017 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht",

    "has_full_text": "no",
    "abstract": "Introduction: Fibrin glue is used commonly during cardiac surgery but can behave as an intracardiac abnormal foreign body following surgery. There have been few such cases reported, and they were typically noticed only because of the resulting catastrophic cardiac conditions, such as valvular malfunction. We report a case where, for the first time, transesophageal echocardiography was used to detected fibrin glue that was adherent to the ventricular side of a patient's aortic valve immediately after aortic declamping. Case presentation: A 45-year-old Japanese man with Marfan syndrome underwent an aortic valve-sparing operation to treat moderate aortic valve regurgitation resulting from enlargement of his right coronary cusp. Fibrin glue was lightly applied to the suture line between the previous and new grafts. Transesophageal echocardiography performed prior to weaning from the cardiopulmonary bypass revealed mild aortic valve regurgitation in addition to a mobile membranous structure attached to the ventricular side of his aortic valve. It was identified as fibrin glue. We resolved the regurgitation by removing the fibrin glue and repeating the aortic cusp plication. The patient had no complications during recovery. Conclusions: Fibrin glue can act as an intracardiac foreign body and lead to a potentially fatal embolism. We demonstrated the use of transesophageal echocardiography to detect a fibrin glue-derived intracardiac abnormal foreign body and to confirm its removal. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case where fibrin glue adherent to the aortic valve was detected by transesophageal echocardiography. These findings demonstrate the importance of using transesophageal echocardiography during cardiac surgery that involves using biological glues.\nCopyright \u00a9 2015 Nakahira et al.; licensee BioMed Central.",

    "abstract": "Background: Fibrin sealants are used in different types of surgery to prevent the accumulation of post-operative fluid (seroma) or blood (haematoma) or to arrest haemorrhage (bleeding). However, there is uncertainty around the benefits and harms of fibrin sealant use. Objectives: To systematically review the evidence on the benefits and harms of fibrin sealants in non-emergency surgery in adults. Data sources: Electronic databases [MEDLINE, EMBASE and The Cochrane Library (including the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, the Health Technology Assessment database and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials)] were searched from inception to May 2015. The websites of regulatory bodies (the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, the European Medicines Agency and the Food and Drug Administration) were also searched to identify evidence of harms. Review methods: This review included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies using any type of fibrin sealant compared with standard care in non-emergency surgery in adults. The primary outcome was risk of developing seroma and haematoma. Only RCTs were used to inform clinical effectiveness and both RCTs and observational studies were used for the assessment of harms related to the use of fibrin sealant. Two reviewers independently screened all titles and abstracts to identify potentially relevant studies. Data extraction was undertaken by one reviewer and validated by a second. The quality of included studies was assessed independently by two reviewers using the Cochrane Collaboration risk-of-bias tool for RCTs and the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination guidance for adverse events for observational studies. A fixed-effects model was used for meta-analysis. Results: We included 186 RCTs and eight observational studies across 14 surgical specialties and five reports from the regulatory bodies. Most RCTs were judged to be at an unclear risk of bias. Adverse events were inappropriately reported in observational studies. Meta-analysis across non-emergency surgical specialties did not show a statistically significant difference in the risk of seroma for fibrin sealants versus standard care in 32 RCTs analysed [n = 3472, odds ratio (OR) 0.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.68 to 1.04; p = 0.13; I<sup>2</sup> = 12.7%], but a statistically significant benefit was found on haematoma development in 24 RCTs (n = 2403, OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.86; p = 0.01; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%). Adverse events related to fibrin sealant use were reported in 10 RCTs and eight observational studies across surgical specialties, and 22 RCTs explicitly stated that there were no adverse events. One RCT reported a single death but no other study reported mortality or any serious adverse events. Five regulatory body reports noted death from air emboli associated with fibrin sprays. Limitations: It was not possible to provide a detailed evaluation of individual RCTs in their specific contexts because of the limited resources that were available for this research. In addition, the number of RCTs that were identified made it impractical to conduct independent data extraction by two reviewers in the time available. Conclusions: The effectiveness of fibrin sealants does not appear to vary according to surgical procedures with regard to reducing the risk of seroma or haematoma. Surgeons should note the potential risk of gasembolism if spray application of fibrin sealants is used and not to exceed the recommended pressure and spraying distance. Future research should be carried out in surgery specialties for which only limited datawere found, including neurological, gynaecological, oral and maxillofacial, urology, colorectal and orthopaedics surgery (for any outcome); breast surgery and upper gastrointestinal (development of haematoma); and cardiothoracic heart or lung surgery (reoperation rates). In addition, studies need to use adequate sample sizes, to blind participants and outcome assessors, and to follow reporting guidelines.\nCopyright \u00a9 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2016.",

Objective: To understand the condition of revascularization of infarcted heart muscle using endothelial progenitor cells combined with degradable fibrin glue materials. Methods: A total of 27 Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into three groups, 9 rats in each group: Non-myocardial infarction group, immediate transplantation group and 1-week post-infarction transplantation group. Then, these three groups were sub-grouped into two groups, respectively: endothelial progenitor cells+fibrin glue group (experimental group) and fibrin glue group (control group). At 3 and 8 weeks after transplantation, the rats were sacrificed in each group. The revascularization and function of infracted heart muscle were observed by microscope, immunohistochemistry and echocardiography. Results And Conclusion: Under the microscope, there were some lax connective tissues between the heart and chest in the experimental groups, but no difference existed between the experimental and control groups. The heart structure was normal relatively and difficult to be distinguished between the experimental and control groups histologically and immunologically, and there was no angeioma, vascular malformation and tumor. The number of revascularization of heart muscle showed no difference between experimental and control groups as well as between different experimental groups. Additionally, there was no significant difference in cardiac function between experimental and control groups. Although there are no positive results of endothelial progenitor cells, we will modify and improve the strategy and believe that the cell delivery system is of benefit and efficacy.\nCopyright \u00a9 2014, Journal of Clinical Rehabilitative Tissue Engineering Research.

Pericardial drainage is performed for the resultant cardiac tamponade, but it is difficult to stop bleeding from the perforation site without surgery. Here, we describe a case in which fibrin glue injected via a 6 F pericardial tube into the pericardium successfully patched a lead perforation.An 85-year-old woman experienced some episodes of syncope. Electrocardiography showed a sinus pause of >5 seconds after paroxysmal atrial fibrillation stopped. Thus, the patient was diagnosed with sick sinus syndrome. Treatment with apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily was initiated for the paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Pacemaker (PM) implantation was performed and apixaban anticoagulation therapy continued. The last intake of apixaban was 3 hours before PM lead screwing. It was planned that a ventricular lead (Revo MRI pacing system 5076-52; Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN,) would be screwed into the right ventricular septal wall via the left subclavian vein, and the position of the lead attachment was confirmed by x-ray fluoroscopy. However, the lead was unintentionally screwed toward the right ventricular free wall, which was revealed by computed tomography after the event. The PM generator (Advisa SR MRI A3SR01; Medtronic) was subcutaneously fixed to the left chest wall. The patient\u2019s blood pressure fell dramatically 3 hours following the procedure, and ultrasonography revealed pericardial effusion.A 6 F pericardial drainage tube (Pericardiocentesis Kit PC101; Merit Medical Systems, Salt Lake City, UT) was inserted, and 250 mL of blood was drained. The patient\u2019s blood pressure and heart rate stabilized, but computed tomography showed ventricular lead perforation (Figure 1). The blood could not flow normally, suggesting that the drainage tube was occluded. The patient\u2019s blood pressure gradually decreased again. A second 6 F drainage tube was inserted into the pericardium, and 500 mL of blood was drained from the second drainage tube. A liquid form of fibrin glue (BOLHEAL; Kaketsuken, Japan), containing 480 mg fibrinogen, 450 units of factor VIII, 6000 KIE of aprotinin, 150 units of thrombin, and 35.4 mg calcium chloride, was injected through the second pericardium tube under angiographic guidance, and the patient\u2019s blood pressure stabilized immediately. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) (1440 mL) was administered intravenously 40 minutes after fibrin glue injection. The volume of the bloody drainage diminished immediately and was completely resolved after 26 hours. Ultrasonography with color Doppler revealed a dome-like structure at the right ventricular apex, where there was a PM lead. The intra-dome space was filled with high echoic substances, in which a small cavity without blood flow was observed on postoperative day 29 (Figure 2). The ventricular lead function was available and was within normal limits (lead impedance, 494 ohm; threshold, 1.25 V/0.4 ms; and R wave, 7.3 mm).Prior to writing this report, we explained the academic worth of publishing this case to the patient. It was difficult for her to sign her name, so documented informed consent was obtained from her family.There were 2 important discoveries in this case. The first is that fibrin glue, which is available for pericardial injection,2 can be used to stop bleeding from a lead perforation hole. A previous report described the transpericardial use of cyanoacrylate glue through an 8 F Judkins right guiding catheter via a 12 F introducer sheath for pacemaker lead perforation.3 In that report, manipulation was required for the Judkins right tip to engage the perforation site. Our method required only a 6 F pericardial catheter and did not require positioning the tip of the catheter.The second discovery is related to the dome-like structure, which we assumed was a pseudoaneurysm. There was no blood flowing through this dome-like structure; instead, the intra-dome space was filled with a high echoic mass that was considered to represent thrombosis formation. Color Doppler showed that the lead perforation hole was large enough to facilitate bidirectional flow (Figure 3). Hence, it is likely that the dome had filled gradually. If the hole had been smaller, it is likely that the flow would have only been unidirectional; this could have led to an increase in the intra-dome pressure and, consequently, to dome rupture.It is likely that apixaban was associated with bleeding from the perforation site.3, 4, 5 While prothrombin complex concentrates work to reverse Factor Xa inhibition caused by drugs like apixaban and may therefore be effective in such situations, it is possible that the FFP had sufficient coagulation factors to stop the bleeding caused by Factor Xa inhibition in this case.6 However, this is only hypothetical, as there is no available report addressing FFP clinical use in such cases. Thus, it is possible that it was not only the fibrin glue that acted as a hemostat, but that the FFP did as well. As noted, there has been no report of FFP supplying Factor Xa inhibited by apixaban,7 but the FFP had a hemostatic effect clinically. It may be that the apixaban concentration decreased because of its own metabolism, the bleeding, and/or infusion. It is uncertain whether cardiac tamponade can be prevented completely. Previous studies supported the use of passive fixation leads and uninterrupted use of warfarin rather than heparin bridging.1, 8 However, in such cases, it might be better to discontinue apixaban rather than to continue it.The present case suggests that fibrin glue injected via a 6 F pericardial tube into the pericardium could patch a PM lead perforation.The authors wish to thank Masami Abe for his great help in the emergency situation.Computed tomography showing ventricular lead perforation.

    "abstract": "Objectives: While effectiveness of fibrin sealants for controlling bleeding in cardiac surgery has been demonstrated, there is a paucity of research on other clinical outcomes of fibrin sealants. In this retrospective observational study we analyzed the clinical outcomes of two different fibrin sealants in a population of patients undergoing cardiac surgical procedures. Methods: Data from patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), valve and valvular procedures with CABG during the years 2008 - 2012 were extracted from Premier's Hospital Database. The Premier Hospital Database is a comprehensive database containing data from over 6 million US hospital discharges annually. Only surgeries in which a fibrin sealant was utilized were included; all other hemostatic agents were excluded from the study. The following clinical outcomes were assessed: major and minor complications, transfusions, surgical revisions for bleeding, operative mortality (hospitalization), OR time and hospital and ICU length of stay (LOS). Logistic regression analyses were performed on categorical outcome variables and GLM regression analyses were performed on continuous outcome variables. Study covariates included: age, primary procedure, Charlson Co-morbidity Index (CCI) score, heparin use, protamine use, admission type, gender, race, teaching hospital, bed size and region. Results: A total of 2,560 inpatient cardiac procedures using fibrin sealant with synthetic aprotinin (FS-apr) were compared to 1,019 procedures using fibrin sealant without aprotinin (FS). Results suggested that FS-apr was associated with significantly lower rates of minor complications (21.1% vs. 27.1%, p = 0.002), Day 1 Transfusions (28.6% vs. 36.8%, p = 0.015) and ICU LOS (4.7 days vs 7.1 days, p < 0.0001) as compared to FS. No significant differences were found between FS-apr and FS on the other clinical outcomes. Conclusions: FS-apr was associated with signficantly lower rates of Day 1 Transfusions, avoidable minor complications and lower average ICU LOS as compared to FS.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Artificial device infection especially with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) often becomes critical in cardiovascular surgery. Topical antibiotic administration has been applied empirically; however, no comprehensive data exist showing long-lasting effects and safety of local antibiotic usage. We assessed fibrin glue (FG) as a slow-release vehicle for vancomycin (VCM) against local MRSA infection by means of animal experiments. Methods: Preliminary in vitro experiments were performed to confirm that the FG-VCM mixture maintained viscosity as a sealant and exhibited slowrelease of VCM. We next created a subcutaneous pocket in rodent back and implanted a 1cm 2 woven graft with 1ml of FG alone, or with serial concentrations of vancomycin (0-120 mg/ml. n= 3 for each group). MRSA of 1*107 colony-forming units (CFU) was injected into the pocket after wound closure. The graft was explanted 7 days later and was submitted for culture ('Culture-graft'); blood samples were obtained for regular blood work, serum VCM concentration measurements and blood culture ('Culture-blood'). The pocket tissue was also submitted to measurement of local VCM concentration. Results: There was a remarkable infectious response in the group without vancomycin; however, no other groups developed any sign of infection. 'Culturegraft' showed MRSA growth only with V0. 'Culture-blood' was negative in all groups, and only minimal serum concentrations of vancomycin were detected. Conclusion: One-dose topical administration of VCM via FG was effective against localized MRSA graft infection without systemic VCM administration. Topical administration of antibiotics may help treat difficult graft infections and reduce systemic use of potent antibiotics.",

    "abstract": "In this study, the coagulation-induced resistance to flow in small-diameter nonpermeable Tygon tubes and permeable expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) vascular grafts was characterized by measuring the upstream pressure needed to purge the coagulum from the tube lumen. This purging pressure was monitored using a closed system that compressed the contents of the tubes at a constant rate. The pressure system was validated using a glycerin series with well-defined viscosities and precisely controlled reductions in cross-sectional area available for flow. This system was then used to systematically probe the upstream pressure buildup as fibrin glue, platelet-rich plasma (PRP) or whole blood coagulated in small-diameter Tygon tubing and or ePTFE grafts. The maximum purging pressures rose with increased clot maturity for fibrin glue, PRP, and whole blood in both Tygon and ePTFE tubes. Although the rapidly coagulating fibrin glue in nonpermeable Tygon tubing yielded highly consistent purging curves, the significantly longer and more variable clotting times of PRP and whole blood, and the porosity of ePTFE grafts, significantly diminished the consistency of the purging curves. \u00a9 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Methods: The model of myocardial infarction was established with ligating the anterior descending branch of the left coronary artery of rats. The EPCs sorted from human umbilical cord blood were injected into the myocardium at the normal region, periphery of the infarcted region and infarcted region. After transplantation for two hours, the tissues at injection sites were removed, the semithin sections were prepared. Distribution of the EPCs carried with fibrin glue were examined. After positioning the implanted cells, the ultrathin sections were prepared. The changes of the autophagic structures in EPCs and compatibility of fibrin with EPCs and myocardium were evaluated. Results: Compared with the normal region, the autophagic EPCs in the periphery of the infarcted region increased, and the autophagic structures in the cells increased. In the infarcted region, EPC autophagy enhanced significantly, and necrosis or apoptosis occurred in some cells. Compatibility of fibrin with EPCs and myocardium was good. The implanted cells in fibrin glue extended well, some EPCs adhered to cardiaomyocytes. Conclusion: When EPCs are transplanted into the periphery of the infarcted region, mild ischemia induces autophagy of the cells, which is beneficial for maintaining survival of the transplanted cells. Carrying EPCs with fibrin glue may avoid of cell lose and promote cell survival.",

This study reports our recent experience with composite aortic root replacement via a slightly modified button-Bentall operation. Fifty-six consecutive patients underwent a Bentall operation on an elective basis from January 2008 through December 2009. In all cases, we used 2 modifications: we imbricated the pledgeted 2-0 polyester interrupted U stitches of the proximal suture line, and at that same suture line we sealed with fibrin glue the possible sources of oozing. The series featured high proportions of associated procedures (25%) and reoperations (23%). The mean cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic cross-clamp times were 166 +/- 50 and 113 +/- 27 min, respectively. No case of operative or hospital (30-day) death was observed. Postoperative drainage amounted to 705 mL (median) on the first postoperative day and 377 mL (mean) on the second. Surgical re-exploration for bleeding was needed in only 1 patient (1.8%). Postoperative acute kidney injury was observed in 5 patients, neurologic complications in 3, and respiratory insufficiency requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation in another 3. Both respiratory and renal complications were significantly associated with greater consumption of blood products (P=0.03 and P=0.001, respectively). We conclude that the combined use of imbricated proximal suture-line stitches and subsequent fibrin-sealant spraying were associated with no deaths and with low rates of bleeding and other adverse postoperative sequelae in our 2-year experience with the Bentall operation in an elective series of patients characterized by a difficult mixture of prognoses. \u00a9 2012 by the Texas Heart Institute, Houston.",

Fibrin glue is effective for maintaining hemostasis after anastomosis and for filling needle holes after cardiothoracic and vascular surgery, but few experimental studies concerning methods of application to obtain more effective hemostasis have been reported. Methods. Bolheal was used as the fibrin glue. Fibrinogen solution (A, 0.3 ml) and thrombin solution (B, 0.3 ml), components of fibrin glue, were applied to the needle holes by the following four methods: group 1 (n = 8), drip method; group 2 (n = 8), spray method; group 3 (n = 8), rub-and-spray method; group 4 (n = 8), rub-andrub method. Additional studies were done in groups 3 and 4 to evaluate the hemostatic effect with different curing times and temperatures. Results. The pressure at which the fibrin sealant ruptured were significantly higher in group 3 (109 +/- 16 mmHg) and group 4 (113 +/- 7) (for both groups: P < 0.05 vs. group 1 (22 +/- 8) and group 2 (64 +/- 10)). The pressure increased with prolongation of the curing time, and significant differences were noted between the pressures at = 2 min and that at 30 s (both groups: P < 0.05 vs. 30 s). The curing temperature had no significant influence in the two groups. Microscopically, the glue effectively plugged the needle holes in groups 3 and 4 Conclusion.

    "abstract": "Background: Surgical site wound complications following cardiothoracic surgery are associated with increased costs, morbidity, and mortality. Several factors have been shown to be associated with an increase in deep and superficial wound healing problems. Recent publications have suggested protective effects of topical autologous blood components with regard to wound healing disturbances after various surgical procedures. The aim of this retrospective analysis was to assess the impact of autologous fibrin glue on surgical site complications in high-risk coronary artery bypass graft patients. Methods: 1394 consecutive patients who underwent CABG surgery from a single centre were included in the study. Autologous fibrin glue was used in 122 patients (8.8%) with elevated risk for wound complications according to institutional guidelines. The demography of both groups was compared and the following outcome variables were analyzed: deep sternal wound infection, sternal re-wiring, bleeding, reexploration rate, and the use of a vacuum assisted closure system. Results: No treatment-related adverse events were noted. The group of patients who received autologous fibrin sealant had significantly higher BMI levels, included more diabetics and repeat cardiac procedures and they underwent percutaneous coronary intervention more often. Furthermore, they were more likely to receive bilateral mammary artery grafts. Despite the high-risk profile of the Fibrin glue group rates of revision, deep sternal wound healing problems tended to be lower than in the control group. Conclusions: In our experience autologous fibrin glue does not invoke any adverse events and serves as a useful adjunct to haemostasis in cardiac surgery. However, the incidence of wound disturbances was similar in both arms of the study. In light of the ever-increasing clinical use a prospective randomized controlled trial examining the impact of autologous fibrin glue is warranted. \u00a9 Springer-Verlag 2011.",

Fibrin glue (FG) provides a reservoir for controlledrelease of growth factors. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) incorporating FG on angiogenesis and cardiac performance in a canine infarct model. Methods: Acute myocardial infarction was induced by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). Group I (n=6) underwent ligation of LAD alone. In Group II, transmural channels were created in the infarct area (n=6). In Group III, nontransmural channels were created to locate FG cylinders containing bFGF (n=6). Eight weeks after operation, myocardial perfusion was assessed by single photon emission computed tomography, cardiac function by echocardiography, and vascular development by immunohistochemical staining. Results: Total vascular density and the number of large vessels (internal diameter >= 50 mum) were dramatically higher in Group III than in Groups I and II at eight weeks. Only the controlled-release group exhibited an improvement in regional myocardial perfusion associated with lower defect score. Animals in Group III presented improved cardiac regional systolic and diastolic functions as well as global systolic function in comparison with the other two groups. Conclusions: Enhanced and sustained angiogenic response can be achieved by controlled-release bFGF incorporating FG within transmyocardial laser channels, thus enabling improvement in myocardial perfusion and cardiac function. \u00a9 Zhejiang University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.",

    "abstract": "The CryoSeal FS System consists of a medical device (the CS-1 instrument) and a proprietary plasma processing disposable that work in concert to rapidly (approximately 60 minutes) prepare both components of a Fibrin Sealant (FS), (cryoprecipitate and thrombin), from a single unit of autologous plasma. When the cryoprecipitate and the thrombin produced by the CryoSeal FS System are mixed together, a Fibrin Sealant is obtained from a single unit of plasma. Furthermore, the CryoSealSystem's ability to also produce human Thrombin eliminates the need to use bovine thrombin present in other fibrin sealants and other adjuncts to hemostasis. The primary objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy and performance of the Fibrin Sealant prepared by the CryoSeal FS System as an adjunct, in terminating bleeding of liver resection, heart valve replacement, aortocoronary shunts and thoraco-abdominal aorta replacement procedures. Materials and methods: The study was designed to use the Fibrin Sealant produced by the CryoSeal System as an adjunct to hemostasis. The product evaluation trial reported here was a clinical study involving total 11 patients for 4 different surgical procedures: liver resections (2), heart valve replacements (3), aortocoronary shunts (4) and thoraco-abdominal aorta (2) replacement procedures. Results: The CryoSeal FS system produced an average 11 mL of fibrin sealant with an average fibrinogen concentration (31 mg/mL) and thrombin activity (50 U/mL). The primary efficacy endpoint for this study was complete hemostasis. In all procedures the CryoSeal FS System derived fibrin Sealant provided complete hemostasis in the peri-operative region. Conclusions: The results of this trial show that the Fibrin Sealant produced by the CryoSeal FS System conforms to its stated characteristics, provides good hemostatic properties and is comparable to the pharmaceutical fibrin adhesive in terms of biocompatibility and adhesiveness.",

Both patients survived and were discharged from our hospital. One has been doing well for 15 months after surgery and the other remains breathing on his own but otherwise nonreactive for 20 months since. We have adopted a patch-and-glue sutureless technique instituting cardiopulmonary bypass for blowout rupture. Cardioplegic arrest was performed to achieve a bloodless surgical field and maximize glue function. All rupture sites should be covered with a properly large patch. This technique is simple, versatile, and considered to be associated with a favorable outcome.",

    "abstract": "Background: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) may promote the neoangiogenesis of myocardial infarction (MI) tissues. However, it is inapplicable to transmit VEGF through the systemic intravenous infusion, and repeated direct myocardial injection induces the damage of normal myocardial structure. Objective: To approach the possibility of VEGF transplantation via degradable fibrin glue on promoting the neoangiogenesis in the MI and ischemic regions, and to observe the variation of heart function of rat models. Design, time and setting: A randomized control animal experiment was carried out in the Coronary Heart Disease VIP Laboratory of the First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University from January 2007 to April 2008. Materials: The recombination protein VEGF121 was constructed by using resin chromatography method to obtain VEGF fibrin glue. Twenty-eight SD rats of 9 weeks old were adopted in this study. Thirteen of them were processed into the ligation of left anterior descending coronary artery, taken as MI group, whereas other 15 animals received the opening of pericardium only, taken as non-MI group. Methods: Immediately following the induction of MI, the VEGF gel and blank gel in the MI group were transplanted into the infarct regions, while those of the non-MI group binded to the anterior wall of left ventricle, and another three rats were untreated, serving as the controls. Main outcome measures: The heart function was detected by echocardialgraphy after 4 weeks posttransplantation, then the rats were sacrificed, and the harvested hearts were determined for the immunohistochemistry and blood vessel measurement analysis. Results: The capillary density of the rats transplanted with VEGF gel in the MI and non-MI groups was significantly higher than that in the blank gel group (P < 0.001); And the capillary density of ischemic region was significant higher than that of septum region (P < 0.01). VEGF gel transplantation could improve the heart function of the rats, but no significant differences were found (P =0.248.2). Conclusion: The degradable materials can transplant VEGF to the non-MI and MI regions in rats, and regenerate obviously the capillary density; It is feasible to transmit vaso regeneration factor to myocardium using fibrin glue.",

This study was conducted to test the feasibility of percutaneous intrapericardial fibrin-glue injection therapy (PIFIT) for LVFWR after acute myocardial infarction and to assess its clinical outcome. From January 2000 to December 2004, LVFWR was confirmed by echocardiography in 22 patients. Thirteen patients showing abrupt hemodynamic collapse failed to recover from resuscitation maneuvers and died <2 hours after LVFWR. The remaining 9 patients (5 women, mean age 73 +/- 10 years) underwent PIFIT. Pericardiocentesis was performed from the subxiphoid process, and a 6Fr pigtail catheter was introduced into the pericardial space. After bloody fluid was drained from the catheter, the fibrin glue was injected into the pericardial space. There were no complications relating to pericardiocentesis and PIFIT. One patient underwent surgical repair on the day of PIFIT because of uncontrollable bleeding from pericardial drainage. In-hospital death as a result of rerupture occurred in 2 patients on days 4 and 7 after PIFIT. Echocardiography during follow-up revealed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or left ventricular restriction. On follow-up at a median of 4.0 years (interquartile range 3.1 to 4.8), 1 noncardiac death occurred at 3.3 months. The other 5 patients were free of cardiovascular events and in New York Heart Association functional class I. In conclusion, PIFIT is a simple, effective, and less invasive technique for the management of LVFWR and thus can be an alternative to surgical repair for LVFWR after acute myocardial infarction. \u00a9 2008 Elsevier Inc.

After FG incorporated with PPV (PPV-FG) was locally administrated in axillary and femoral arteries of dogs, PPV concentrations in artery vessels surrounding the administration sites were compared with the concentrations at the same sites in dogs given PPV solution. The properties of PPV's release in vitro and maintenance in vessel as well as the influence on the mean peripheral blood pressure and drug concentration in peripheral vein after the introduction PPV-FG on the surface of artery in dogs were evaluated.

    "abstract": "Perforation or rupture of a coronary artery with subsequent pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade is a potentially life-threatening complication of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Several emergency treatment strategies exist to close the perforation including reversal of anticoagulation, prolonged balloon inflation, implantation of stent grafts, local injection of thrombogenic molecules, placement of microcoils, or open heart surgery. Here we report on a 66-year-old patient who underwent urgent PCI for acute stent thrombosis in the proximal LAD. The artery was reopened, a new stent implanted successfully, and a GPIIb/IIIa-antagonist was given. Shortly thereafter the patient suffered from cardiac tamponade requiring pericardiocentesis and pericardial drainage. The coronary angiogram indicated a severe guide wire-induced perforation and pericardial effusion originating from a distal diagonal branch segment. Prolonged balloon inflation did not stop the leakage. Therefore the monorail balloon was exchanged for an over-the-wire balloon. A two-component commercial fibrin glue consisting of fibrinogen and thrombin was rapidly but separately injected through the wire channel of the balloon into the distal segment of the diagonal branch. The coronary leak was successfully closed and the patient recovered quickly. In comparison with the previously reported cases of thrombin injection important differences should be noticed: (1) a two-component hemostatic seal was used without reversal of anticoagulation, (2) rapid injection instead of prolonged infusion of the hemostatic drugs was performed, and (3) the rescue technique was applied in a cath lab that routinely uses monorail catheter systems. Therefore we consider this a novel and effective approach for closure of coronary ruptures. \u00a9 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

Neonatal ventricular cardiomyocytes from one-day male SD rats were isolated, labeled and cultured. The cells were injected into the infarcted area three weeks later. The animals were randomized into four recipient groups: (1) cardiomyocytes plus fibrin sealant (group CF, n=10); (2) cardiomyocytes alone (group C, n=10); (3) fibrin sealant recipients alone (group F, n=10); (4) control group (n=10). Four weeks after transplantation, echocardiography and Langerdoff model were used to assess heart function. Immunohistochemical staining and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were performed to track the implanted cardiomyocytes and detect the sex-determining region Y gene on Y chromosome. Results: Echocardiography showed the fraction shortening (FS) in groups CF, C, F and control group was (27.80+/-6.32)%, (22.29+/-4.54)%, (19.24+/-6.29)% and (20.36+/-3.29)% respectively with statistically significant differences in group CF compared with the other groups (P<0.05).

    "abstract": "Today, there is an enormous interest in surgical sealant, not only for hemostasis, but also for binding of tissues together during surgery, and to improve wound healing. Man has imitated nature in developing fibrin sealant that is biodegradable. However, the risk of transmission of both known and unknown infectious agents can generally not be ruled out completely for plasma products from donors. In addition there is a considerable immunologic risk of using biological products of animal origin. Preclinical and clinical data has demonstrated that a safe and useable surgical fibrin sealant can be prepared from the patient's own blood using the enzyme batroxobin. Experimental data showed that patient-derived fibrin sealant provided enhanced instant adhesion strength and elasticity compared with conventional fibrin sealant due to its faster polymerisation rate. Test methods for fibrin sealant were found to be inaccurate, and we constructed and validated a new computer assisted test method to get information about elasticity and other dynamic properties of biological sealant. The method is highly reproducible and is the first validated using vital human tissue as the adhesion substrate. It takes about one half hour to prepared patient-derived fibrin sealant, which may turn a good operation into a perfect operation without any known risk.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: FV inhibitors are a largely preventable iatrogenic coagulopathy in which the frequency is increasing in clinical practice. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Three cases associated with our institution are reported. A systematic review of the MEDLINE database was performed, and reference lists were reviewed to identify relevant publications. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-six cases of FV inhibitors have been reported in the world's literature. Eighty-seven have been reported in the last decade, of which two thirds are due to exposure to bovine thrombin. Bovine thrombin-associated FV antibodies develop in 40 to 66 percent of cardiac surgery patients and in 20 percent of neurosurgery patients. Thirty-three percent of reported patients developed bleeding complications. Inhibitors persisted on average 2.3 months. Standard coagulation assays do not reliably predict clinical manifestations. Multimodality therapy, including immunosuppression, is useful for treatment of symptomatic patients. CONCLUSIONS: FV inhibitors are a common complication of bovine thrombin exposure that can have devastating clinical consequences. Transfusion medicine specialists and hematologists can play a critical role in reducing the incidence of FV inhibitors by educating the medical community about safer alternative fibrin sealants.",

    "has_full_text": "no",
    "abstract": "Objectives: The efficacy of a fibrin sealant in paediatric cardiac surgery has been demonstrated. However, its effectiveness in the presence of significant untreated coagulopathy has not been addressed. This study was designed to investigate the role of the topical application of a fibrin sealant, Beriplast P (BP), in the presence of coagulopathy following paediatric cardiac surgery. Methods: After confirming the presence of significant post-bypass coagulopathy, patients undergoing repair of congenital heart defects using cardiopulmonary bypass were randomised to the use of BP (group BP) or no intervention (group C). BP was applied over suture lines and microvascular bleeding sites. Criteria for transfusion of blood and blood products were standardised for both groups. Outcome variables were: (1) post-operative bleeding; (2) transfusion of blood and blood products; (3) theatre time to achieve haemostasis; (4) ventilation time, intensive therapy unit (ITU) and hospital stay. Results: Fifty-two patients (n=26 in each group), aged 3 days to 17.4 years were recruited. There were no hospital deaths and no significant differences in demographic or intraoperative variables that might have affected the chosen endpoints. After protamine, all patients in both groups had significant coagulopathy (P<=0.05 versus baseline). There were fewer patients receiving transfusions of fresh frozen plasma (FPP) in the intervention group, when compared to the control group (P<=0.05). Patients receiving BP spent less time in theatre to achieve haemostasis (P<=0.05), had a lesser amount of bleeding intraoperatively (P<=0.01), at 4h (P<=0.05) and at 24h (P<=0.05), required a lower amount of transfusions of red cells (P<=0.01), FPP (P<=0.05) and platelets (P<=0.05). There were no differences in ventilation time, length of stay in ITU or in hospital. Conclusions: Even in the presence of significant coagulopathy, intraoperative use of fibrin sealant in paediatric cardiac surgery reduces the amount of bleeding and need for transfusions of blood and blood products. The theatre time necessary to achieve haemostasis is also significantly reduced. These findings have a potential to improve clinical outcomes and enhance cost benefits. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

Here we report the successful therapy of ventricular rupture by percutaneous intrapericardial instillation of fibrin glue in a 72-year-old male patient with postinfarct angina secondary to anterior myocardial infarction.Rupture of the ventricular myocardium after myocardial infarction is a dramatic and often lethal complication. Due to the dramatic hemodynamic dysfunction, immediate therapies are imperative. As surgical repair of the defect is often not available, percutaneous intrapericardial instillation of fibrin glue can be an alternative.A 72-year-old male patient with postinfarct angina secondary to anterior myocardial infarction was transferred to our center from a community hospital after administration of systemic thrombolytic therapy using streptokinase. Coronary angiography showed single vessel disease with high grade stenosis of the LAD. Stent implantation was successfully performed with uncomplicated postinterventional course. On day three, the patient developed another episode of angina. Recatheterization excluded acute restenosis or stent thrombosis. On the same day, the patient developed rapid onset cardiogenic shock with need for resuscitation, intubation, high dose catecholamine treatment, and an intra-aortic balloon pump. Echocardiography showed an acute pericardial tamponade suggesting a ventricular rupture (Figure 1(a)). Pericardiocentesis was performed, and large amounts of blood could be aspirated and were directly retransfused. Hemodynamics stabilised only under constant aspiration. As ultima ratio, we instillated a total of 30\u2009mL of a two-component fibrin glue normally used for bleeding ulcers in gastroenterology. This resulted in a sustained hemodynamic stabilization. The patient could be weaned off the balloon pump and catecholamines in the following three days. Echocardiography showed a stable minor pericardial effusion of 100\u2009mL without any signs of hemodynamic relevance (Figure 1(b)). Unfortunately, on day nine, the patient gradually developed signs of progressive cardiogenic shock again with the need of cathecolamine treatment and finally died from pump failure on day 13. Serial echocardiographic evaluations were negative for relevant pericardial effusion. Autopsy revealed a fibrin glue induced focal peri-epicardial adhesion and extensive anterior myocardial infarction with rupture near the apex covered by the fibrin glue (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)). No relevant pericardial effusion was found.Rupture of the ventricular wall is an often lethal complication of acute myocardial infarction. Besides myocardial infarction ventricular rupture has also been reported after cardiac trauma, valve replacement, and cardiac tumors. In the setting of myocardial infarction ventricular rupture occurs in 2%\u20136% of all patients and is third to cardiogenic shock and arrhythmias as the leading cause of death after myocardial infarction [1]. The majority (90%) of ventricular wall rupture occurs within nine days of infarction: 27% within the first day and 26% after 6 to 9 days. Although thrombolytic therapy contributes significantly to reperfusion and overall survival, it slightly increases the risk for early ventricular rupture [2]. First described by William Harvey in 1647, successful surgery of left ventricular rupture after myocardial infarction was first reported by Fitzgibbon et al. in 1972 [3]. Surgical techniques include resection of the necrotic area and closure of the perforation with Teflon either by suture or glue [1]. Over the last 30 years, the incidence of cardiac rupture has declined mostly likely due to increasing use of reperfusion strategies and adjunct medical therapy [4]. Despite some advances in the surgery of ventricular rupture, mortality remains high with reported mortality rates ranging between 75% and 90% [4]. This high mortality rate is likely due to the short time frame between ventricular rupture and surgical closure of the defect. Acute cardiac surgery is not always available, and most patients have severe left ventricular dysfunction further contributing to the already severely limited prognosis. Although Figueras et al. reported that long-term survival of selected patients with prompt hemodynamic recovery after left ventricular wall rupture is possible without surgical repair [5], the devastating hemodynamics of the majority of patients warrants immediate treatment. When immediate heart surgery is not available or applicable as in our case, intrapericardial injection of fibrin glue as reported here facilitates an alternative treatment in this desperate situation. Autopsy revealed focal peri- and epicardial adhesion of the defect by fibrin glue, proving its effectiveness. Murata et al. reported similar results on autopsy after intrapericardial fibrin injection [6]. Intrapericardial fibrin injection was first reported in 1995 by Ogiwara et al. [7] after the same group had tested the feasibility in dogs. While there have been sporadically reports of interpericardial fibrin injection over the last 20 years [6, 8], there are only two small descriptive case report studies reporting the follow-up of patients with left ventricular wall rupture that received intrapericardial fibrin glue injections [9, 10]. Survival rates were 31% and 55% with a total of 28 patients studied. However, a considerable number of patients died before fibrin glue could be administered. This and the few other case reports on the medical treatment of left ventricular wall rupture are by far not sufficient to provide a general recommendation; however, due to its dramatic presentation and often lethal outcome, intrapericardial fibrin injection should be considered in patients with an oozing rupture of the ventricular wall as a last resort.

    "abstract": "Surgical procedures are inevitably associated with bleeding. The amount of blood loss may vary widely between different surgical procedures and depends on surgical as well as non-surgical factors. Whereas adequate surgical haemostasis may suffice in most patients, pro-haemostatic pharmacological agents may be of additional benefit in patients with (diffuse) surgical bleeding or in patients with a specific underlying haemostatic defect. In general, surgical haemostasis and pharmacological therapies can be complementary in controlling blood loss. The use of pharmacological therapies to reduce blood loss and blood transfusions in surgery has historically been restricted to a few drugs. Antifibrinolytic agents (aprotinin, tranexamic acid and aminocaproic acid) have the best evidence supporting their use, especially in cardiac surgery, liver transplantation and some orthopaedic surgical procedures. Meta-analyses of randomised, controlled trials in cardiac patients have suggested a slight benefit of aprotinin, compared with the other antifibrinolytics. Desmopressin is the treatment of choice in patients with mild haemophilia A and von Willebrand disease. It has also been shown to be effective in patients undergoing cardiac surgery who received aspirin up to the time of operation. However, overall evidence does not support a beneficial effect of desmopressin in patients without pre-existing coagulopathy undergoing elective surgical procedures. Topical agents, such as fibrin sealants have been successfully used in a variety of surgical procedures. However, only very few controlled clinical trials have been performed and scientific evidence supporting their use is still limited. Novel drugs, like recombinant factor VIIa (eptacog alfa), are currently under clinical investigation. Recombinant factor VIIa has been introduced for the treatment of haemophilia patients with inhibitors, either in surgical or non-surgical situations. Preliminary data indicate that it may also be effective in surgical patients without pre-existing coagulation abnormalities. More clinical trials are warranted before definitive conclusions can be drawn about the safety and the exact role of this new drug in surgical patients. Only adequately powered and properly designed randomised, clinical trials will allow us to define the most effective and the safest pharmacological therapies for reducing blood loss and transfusion requirements in surgical patients. Future trials should also consider cost-effectiveness because of considerable differences in the costs of the available pro-haemostatic pharmacological agents.",

Methods: Cardiac wrapping was performed using a tissue adhesive (biological fibrin glue: Beriplast P) between the ventricular surface and latissimus dorsi, without any direct suturing to the myocardium. To prevent ischemia of latissimus dorsi, prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) 6mu g/kg/day was administered for 10 days, starting during the perioperative period. Electrical stimulation for cardiac assist was provided with a DDD pacemaker starting on postoperative day 1. The animals were divided into two groups: those administered PGE1 (group 1) and those not administered PGE1 (group 2). The following were evaluated one month after surgery: aortic pressure, aortic blood flow, hemodynamics (echocardiography), cardiac function, and histological findings. Results: Aortic pressure with electrical stimulation increased by 11% in group 1 (p<0.01) and 7% in group 2 (p<0.01). Aortic blood flow with electrical stimulation increased by 23% in group 1 (p<0.01) and 18% in group 2 (p<0.01). Echocardiography clearly visualized latissimus dorsi wrapping after surgery. Increased contraction of the left ventricular cavity with stimulation versus no stimulation was confirmed. The ejection fraction increased by 12% in group 1 (p<0.01) and 10% in group 2 (p<0.05). Echocardiography revealed no significant changes in left ventricular diastolic diameter with stimulation versus no stimulation in either group. Histological examination of group 1 revealed satisfactory adhesion between the latissimus dorsi and the ventricular surface, and ischemic sites in latissimus dorsi were limited to the peripheral aspect. However, in group 2, marked degenerative changes in the adhesion surface, as well as scattered sites of ischemia throughout the latissimus dorsi, were observed. Conclusion: The use of biological fibrin glue during cardiac wrapping provided effective adhesion between the latissimus dorsi and ventricular surface, resulting in beneficial hemodynamic effects. The use of PGE1 reduced ischemic changes in the latissimus dorsi immediately after dynamic cardiomyoplasty. These findings suggest that biological fibrin glue and PGE1 may be useful in preventing latissimus dorsi dysfunction, thus improve contractility of dynamic cardiomyoplasty.",

A new FG, Hemaseel APR, is Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for hemostasis during cardiac surgery and splenic trauma. This study was undertaken to determine if Hemaseel FG prevents intra-abdominal adhesions, and to compare it to cryo FG. Forty-five rats underwent laparotomy. Bilateral peritoneal-muscular defects were created. Polypropylene mesh was sewn into each defect with a running silk suture. The bowel was abraded with gauze. The rats were then randomized to mesh covered with Hemaseel FG, cryo FG, or control. On postoperative day 7, the severity of adhesions were graded by percentage of mesh covered by adhesion (0-100%) and degree of adhesion (0-3). The mean percentage of mesh covered by adhesion was 9% for Hemaseel FG, 43% for cryo FG (p = .005), and 65% for the controls (p < .0001). The mean density adhesion score was 0.5 for Hemaseel FG, 1.2 for cryo FG (p = .04), and 2.1 for the controls (p < .0001). In the Hemaseel FG group, 77% of patches had no adhesions, compared with 37% in the cryo FG group (p = .004) and 13% in the controls (p < .0001). Thus, Hemaseel FG significantly decreases intra-abdominal adhesions, and is more effective than cryo FG.",

    "abstract": "Hemostasis is a prerequisite for wound healing, and under normal physiologic conditions, it is achieved by means of the coagulation cascade. However, there are a number of surgical procedures where there may be considerable benefits to the patient, surgeon, or health-care costs if hemostasis can be achieved more efficiently. The rapid and effective control of bleeding during and after surgery reduces blood loss and can help reduce postoperative complications. These improved outcomes can reduce the need for transfusion, with the associated risk of viral transmission, and have a positive impact on operative and hospital stay times. Fibrin sealants are surgical hemostatic agents derived from human plasma that reproduce the final steps in the coagulation pathway and form a stable fibrin clot. Fibrin sealants are used in a broad range of surgical procedures to assist hemostasis, including cardiovascular, hepatic, and splenic surgery, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, skin grafting, and dental extractions in anticoagulated patients. Patients with coagulopathies are at high risk of prolonged or excessive bleeding during or after invasive surgery, and these patients may also benefit from the use of fibrin sealants. This article reviews the role of fibrin sealants in hemostasis, citing a number of key clinical studies that report a significant reduction in blood loss or chest drain output after surgery with fibrin sealant compared with controls. \u00a9 2001 Excerpta Medica, Inc.

Although fibrin sealant (Beriplast, Aventis Behring, Marburg, Germany) has been widely used as a supplementary measure for hemostasis during cardiac surgery in Europe and is becoming popular in the United States, the pharmocokinetics of fibrin sealant applied in pericardial space has not been elucidated. Methods. A small incision was made on the epicardial surface of the left ventricle of a rat, and the incision was sutured. Total 0.2 ml of fibrin sealant containing iodine 125 (<sup>125</sup>I)-labeled fibrinogen, aprotinin, blood coagulation factor XIII and thrombin was applied to the area around the suture line. Results. Distributions of <sup>125</sup>I-labeled fibrinogen in the heart on postoperative days 1, 3, 7, and 14 were 48.2% +/- 1.8%, 20.7% +/- 2.2%, 0.15% +/- 0.02%, and 0.01% +/- 0.02%, respectively. The radioactivity was negligible in the blood, liver, spleen, and kidney except for the thyroid in which the radioactivity increased to 7.9% +/- 0.7% and 4.3% +/- 0.4%, respectively, on postoperative days 7 and 14. Iodine 125-labeled fibrinogen concentrations of the heart and other organs showed a similar change in the time course of distribution. Dense and thick fibrin network, observed on postoperative day 1, had dissipated and was thinner with collagen formation by postoperative day 7. Conclusions. Fibrin sealant applied to the pericardial cavity regresses rapidly and plays an important role in wound healing. \u00a9 2000 by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.",

Methods. Thirty patients undergoing elective cardiac operation were randomized to receive Vivostat fibrin sealant applied to either the right or left side of the sternum immediately after median sternotomy, with the untreated side serving as control. Results. The average time to hemostasis was 43 seconds after treatment with Vivostat and 180 seconds on the control sides (p < 0.001). At the end of the operation, complete hemostasis was observed on 24 of 30 sides treated with Vivostat compared with on 4 of 30 of the control sides (p < 0.001). The average volume of sealant used to cover one side of the sternum was 0.9 mL. Conclusions.

Before 1996, FG was used to a limited extent in Thailand due to the high cost. Technology for locally prepared FG was transferred to Bangkok International Hemophilia Training Center of the World Federation of Hemophilia (IHTC-WFH) in July 1996 by Prof. Uri Martinowitz and the late Prof. Henri Horoszowski. Since then FG has been widely used and proved to be very useful in Thailand. This paper reports 145 cases using low cost locally prepared FG at Ramathibodi Hospital during November 1996 to December 1997. A total of 145 cases with age range from 5 months to 73 years, which included 55 pediatrics and 90 adults, 100 males and 45 females. The amount of FG used was 1-80 ml per case. Clinical procedures included dental surgery (46), open heart surgery (35), ENT (28), orthopedic (13) including 2-3 joint correction in one session in 2 hemophiliacs, neurology (11), plastic repair (7), liver (2) and severe bleeding in dengue hemorrhagic fever (3). Forty-seven cases had hemostatic disorders. The result of local hemostatic, adhesive and sealant effect of FG was satisfactory with no complications. In open heart surgery, the amount of content in chest drain decreased and none required reopen-surgery to stop bleeding. Dental surgery was performed in 43 patients with bleeding disorders i.e. hemophilia, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, leukemia, severe thrombocytopenia, patients on anticoagulant, etc. Only 3 cases (7%) required blood component compared to all of the 50 no-FG controlled cases (100%) that required blood component therapy. FG has proved to be very useful in many aspects i.e. minimizing blood product usage, decreasing medical workload, reducing medical cost and increasing patients' convenience and satisfaction in particular.",

    "has_full_text": "no",
    "abstract": "Background. The Vivostat System is a medical device for the preparation of an autologous fibrin sealant from 120 mL of the patient's blood in the operating room. The system is fully automated and microprocessor controlled and is made up of three components: an automated processor unit, an automated applicator unit, and a disposable, single-patient-use unit, which includes a preparation set and a Spraypen applicator. The biochemical process is initiated by batroxobin, which acts upon the fibrinogen in the patient's plasma. The completion of the process depends entirely on endogenous thrombin in producing the sealant. Methods. Twenty-four volunteer patients undergoing elective primary coronary artery bypass grafting were randomized to either conventional hemostasis (control group) or the use of Vivostat fibrin sealant as an adjunct to conventional hemostasis. The patients were followed up at 1 month and 1 year. Results. The preparation process was completed in 30 minutes. No safety issues associated with the use of the sealant were identified. From 120 mL of the patient's blood the yield of fibrin sealant was 4.5 mL (range, 3.9 to 4.8 mL). There was a favorable trend toward lower amounts of chest tube drainage in the Vivostat group. In the Vivostat group, 1 of 11 patients (9%) required a perioperative transfusion and in the control group 3 of 12 patients (25%) required a perioperative transfusion. Conclusions. It is possible to prepare autologous fibrin sealant with the Vivostat system in 30 minutes. No exogenous thrombin is required. The sealant has no known adverse effects and may prove to be a useful adjunct to hemostasis in cardiothoracic surgery.",

    "abstract": "Background and aims of the study: Although pulmonary autograft (PA) offers many theoretical advantages, the operation is more complex and the need for extensive reconstruction carries an increased risk for postoperative bleeding. The study aim was to evaluate the impact of different pharmacological and surgical strategies on total blood loss and blood product requirements after PA use. Methods: Between July 1994 and March 1997, 26 patients (22 males) with a mean age of 26 +/- 8 years (range: 11 to 36 years) underwent aortic valve replacement with PA (22 root; four subcoronary implant). A relatively high incidence of re-exploration for bleeding (n = 3) and significant total blood loss during our early experience (Group I, n = 8), prompted the subsequent introduction of different strategies (Group II, n = 18). These included perioperative use of aprotinin, reinforcement of suture lines of the neo-aortic root with autologous pericardium and accurate hemostasis of the raw surface on the back of the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) during a brief period of circulatory arrest, also with application of fibrin glue. Results: There were no hospital deaths. No patients in group II required re-exploration or transfusion, and mean total postoperative blood loss was reduced (group I, 720 +/- 465 ml/m<sup>2</sup> body surface area (BSA), versus group II, 323 +/- 84 ml/m<sup>2</sup> BSA). By-pass and aortic cross- clamp times were not significantly longer in group II patients. At a mean follow up of 15 months, all 25 survivors are asymptomatic, in NYHA functional class I, and with normal social interactions. Conclusions: Early survival after aortic valve replacement with the PA appears comparable with the use of more conventional valve substitutes. Blood loss containment by routine application of medical and surgical strategies appears feasible. In view of the common concern about blood transfusion, particularly in young patients, these findings may help to widen the range of indications for the Ross procedure.",

Three anastomoses leaked and two were noted to be stenosed at completion of the anastomosis. One leak was sealed by application of fibrin glue.

Previously published reports have attempted to clarify the possible role of fibrin glue in the inhibition of the formation of intrapericardial adhesions following cardiac surgery. Earlier work hypothesized that fibrin glue may reduce the severity of postoperative adhesions and that the use of autologous fibrin glue may have similar effects, without the risks that accompany homologous blood products. Six juvenile farm pigs were utilized to test this hypothesis. Conventional fibrin glue and single-donor fibrin glue were tested in open-heart surgery. This experimental model was also reexamined and found to be of significant utility in simulating adult reoperative cardiac surgery. The fibrin glue subjects were universally easier to reoperate due to fewer adhesions, as demonstrated grossly and histologically. The single-donor fibrin glue had no significant advantage on adhesion formation, when compared to the conventional fibrin glue group, but the ramifications of formulating fibrin glue in this fashion offer a significant benefit toward the complete use of autologous blood products in open-heart surgery.",

    "has_full_text": "no",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: More than 2300 clinical papers have been published on the surgical applications of fibrin sealant (FS), with the largest number in the speciality of cardiothoracic surgery. The purpose of this review of the literature was to find and evaluate controlled studies published in the field of cardiothoracic surgery, to clarify the indications and emphasize the benefits of FS available to the practising surgeon. METHODS: A database of the surgical publications of FS was created. Up to the end of 1995, at least 24 controlled clinical studies had been published; these may be divided into 20 studies with a positive outcome and 4 studies where the results were not different from the controls. In none of the studies was the clinical result worse after the use of FS. RESULTS: In most of the cardiac studies, FS was successfully used at bleeding sites in reoperations and in congenital heart surgery. Postoperative bleeding may also be reduced by the anterior mediastinal spray application of FS or by preparing woven Dacron prostheses with the sealant. In addition, Fs has been found to improve results after type A aortic disections and, by adding an antibiotic to the sealant, the postoperative infection rate for active endocarditis of the aortic root can be reduced. In pulmonary surgery FS can be used to reduce pulmonary air leakage, however the results of some studies diverge due to different clinical test conditions and the inclusion of only a small number of patients in the \"negative\" studies. In none of the controlled studies of esophageal surgery could FS prevent leakage from esophageal anastomoses. CONCLUSIONS: Fibrin sealant is safe when it is applied properly, but there is a learning curve for surgeons who start using it. An autologous sealant or a sealant containing human instead of bovine thrombin is preferred, since repeated use of bovine thrombin may induce coagulopthies. The number of controlled clinical studies of FS is currently increasing, with the majority of the papers revealing a beneficial effect of FS when it is used as a hemostatic or sealing agent in cardiothoracic surgery.",

The sutureless technique allows, in our opinion, a more confident and safe aggressive attitude to subacute left ventricular free wall rupture.",

    "abstract": "Left ventricular rupture after acute myocardial infarction occurs more often than suspected and diagnosis is rarely made before death. Left ventricular rupture has been reported to contribute to the overall in-hospital mortality after acute myocardial infarction in up to 24% of cases and to be present in 40% of patients dying within the first week after infarction. Only prompt diagnosis and aggressive surgical treatment can be lifesaving under these circumstances. Between February 1991 and August 1993 five patients underwent emergency operation for left ventricular rupture after acute myocardial infarction using exclusively transoesophageal echocardiography as a diagnostic tool. All patients had evidence of cardiac tamponade and electrocardiography showed signs of anterolateral acute myocardial infarction in one, inferolateral acute myocardial infarction in three and lateral acute myocardial infarction in one. In two cases the infarcted area was debrided and an interrupted pledgetted 2/0 polypropylene suture was placed from inside of the ventricle outward to the epicardial surface and then through the pericardial patch. In the other three cases an original technique was used: an autologous glutaraldehyde-stiffened pericardial patch was sealed over the infarcted area using fibrin glue and fixed with running suture on the surrounding healthy myocardium. One patient died in the operating room because of low cardiac output syndrome which was possibly the result of an excessively extended area of infarction. Left ventricular rupture is a catastrophic complication of acute myocardial infarction and prompt diagnosis with transoesophageal echocardiography followed by emergency operation can be lifesaving. The surgical technique with pericardial patch and fibrin glue, without infarct excision, used in three patients, can be a useful and simple surgical option in this pathology when no active bleeding is observed from the tear.",

    "abstract": "Ten cases of experimental atrial rupture were created in five pigs by cutting into both atria. The defects measured approximately 3.0 x 1.0 cm. Bleeding was stopped by applying a tangential clamp and the defect in the atrium was sealed with fibrin glue (mean volume 2.0 ml, range 1.5-2.5 ml) with a mean fibrin concentration of 23 mg/ml. The mean pressures in the atria were 11 cmH<inf>2</inf>O in the left and 10 cmH<inf>2</inf>O in the right atrium. The clamp was released after 5 min and the atria were observed for bleeding for 30 min. In four animals, immediate haemostasis was obtained. In one animal, both atria leaked after release of the clamp because too little fibrin glue was applied, but complete haemostasis teas obtained at a second attempt. All experimental atrial defects could be sealed with fibrin glue (P = 0.03), and we believe, based on our experimental results, that fibrin glue may have a place in emergency cases to improve the management of atrial injury. In conclusion successful repair of experimental atrial rupture was performed by the use of fibrin glue.",

    "has_full_text": "no",
    "abstract": "Repair of the acute aortic insufficiency associated with type A aortic dissection is now preferred to valve replacement. This is generally achieved by resuspending the aortic valve using different types of suturing techniques, with sutures usually passing through the aortic wall, which causes bleeding at the suture sites. We suggest, instead, simply injecting fibrin glue between the two dissected layers of the aortic annulus, which achieves resuspension of the aortic valve and reinforces the proximal stump without the need for any sutures. To evaluate the efficacy of this simple technique, the cases of 15 consecutive patients who underwent operative intervention for the treatment of the type A aortic dissection associated with acute aortic insufficiency between January 1989 and July 1993 were reviewed. The mean patient age was 63 +/- 11.2 years (range, 43 to 74 years). All had massive 3+ or 4+ aortic insufficiency, documented preoperatively by transesophageal echocardiography. None had any history of aortic regurgitation. In all patients, the aortic repair was done in conjunction with a supracoronary replacement of the ascending aorta with a collagen-impregnated graft attached using a running suture, after reinforcement of the dissected tissues with glue. There was one non-valve-related early death (6.7%) and no late mortality. At a mean follow-up of 2.3 years, all patients were in New York Heart Association functional class I and had a mean aortic insufficiency grade of 0.3 (range, 0 to 1+). Follow-up computed tomography in all patients showed closure of the dissecting process on the proximal ascending aorta. These results suggest that the use of fibrin glue may represent a simple and effective technique for repairing the acute aortic insufficiency associated with aortic dissection. This technique facilitates performance of the operation, reduces the operative time, avoids the need for suturing during aortic valve repair which can make the aortic wall fragile, and reinforces dissected tissues before replacement of the ascending aorta.",

    "abstract": "A 66-year old man was hospitalized with chest pain and acute ischaemia of the lower limbs highly suggestive of dissection of the aorta. Computed tomography and aortography however showed pericardic effusion and thrombosis situated in the iliac bifurcation of the aorta. During the emergency operation, acute tamponade required sub-xyphoid drainage. The haemodynamic situation was reestablished and the operation continued but within minutes a cataclysmal haemorrhage occurred through the drainage tube due to ischaemic rupture of the lateral wall of the heart into the pericardium. Extra-corporal circulation was installed immediately and a large polytetrafluoroethylene patch was sutured to the epicardium, distally from the necrosed area, in healthy tissue. A biological fibrin glue was injected under the patch. The operation was terminated with an axillo-bifemoral bypass. The postoperative period was satisfactory and the patient was discharged. At the six months examination, the patient was in NYHA class II and the echography showed moderate left ventricular dysfunction with grade II mitral regurgitation and a false aneurysm facing the area of necrosis. This technique allowed us to patch the rupture without excessive tension on the sutures in the fragile tissue which would have increased the risk of secondary rupture. In addition, the large patch avoided excessive reduction in volume of the left ventricular cavity and saved the mitral chordae which would have been destroyed by direct suture. This method can be an effective salvage technique for heart rupture during the acute phase of myocardial infarction and offers the possibility of a second look in case of a secondary false aneurysm.",

We have composed an analogous compound in our operating rooms using cryoprecipitate and topical thrombin (1000 units/ml) in equal volumes applied directly to the bleeding site. We have used cryoprecipitate-topical thrombin glue in 26 patients undergoing cardiac operations. Severe bleeding not responding to usual methods of control was encountered during or after coronary artery bypass (n = 17), valve replacement (n = 3), bypass plus valve replacement (n = 5), or repair of postinfarction ventricular septal defect (n = 1). Five patients were operated on emergently and four were undergoing their second cardiac operation. The glue was used in four patients while on bypass and fully heparinized and in 17 patients who continued to bleed after separation from bypass and administration of protamine. Hemostasis was achieved in all patients and none required reexploration for bleeding. In five patients undergoing reexploration for postoperative hemorrhage (none having received cryoprecipitate-topical thrombin glue during the initial operation), the glue provided hemostasis when other measures failed, and no additional reexplorations were needed. No patient exhibited hypersensitivity, fibrinolysis, or coagulopathy following the use of this glue. In 16 patients followed for 9 to 12 months postoperatively, no hepatitis has occurred. The highly concentrated fibrinogen in cryoprecipitate is activated by thrombin to form fibrin and bring about rapid hemostasis.

The fibrin glue sealant has also been employed to control bleeding from needle holes and small anastomotic tears in 22 patients. No patient in this series had a bleeding complication from a suture line or graft treated with fibrin glue. This experience indicates that like fibrin glue from pooled blood, fibrin glue from single-donor plasma is effective as a graft sealant and topical hemostatic agent. Preparation of fibrin glue from single-donor plasma is simple and economical, and may provide cardiothoracic surgeons in the United States with a widely available, valuable hemostatic adjunct.",

    "abstract": "Fibrin glue Beriplast was used during cardiovascular surgery in 97 patients. The fibrin seal was used for hemostasis on anastomoses, patches and suture lines. Moreover, the glue was applied to epicardial fixation of aorto-coronary vein grafts to prevent postoperative graft kinking. Following extrapleural ligation of patent duct in premature infants, the parietal pleura was fastened to the thoracic wall to prevent extrapleural pneumothorax or hemorrhage. After accidental dissection of the thoracic duct in infants, leakage of chyle could be sealed successfully in 6 cases. Hemorrhage from the sealed surfaces of suture lines was not observed. Viral hepatitis occurred postoperatively in 2 patients (3% of the operations for acquired heart disease), both of whom had also received clotting factor concentrate and blood transfusion because of postoperative hemorrhage not related to fibrin sealed surfaces. A causal releation between the hepatitis and application of the pasteurized fibrin glue seems very unlikely. Although fibrin glue certainly cannot replace the surgical suture, it appears to be a valuable aid under special conditions.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the cost-effectiveness of the use of CryoSeal, an allogeneic single-donor fibrin sealant, in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).\n\nMETHODS: This randomized clinical study involved seven cardiac surgery centres in the Netherlands. Patients undergoing elective isolated CABG with the use of at least one internal thoracic artery (ITA) graft were assigned randomly to receive either CryoSeal (5ml per ITA bed) or no CryoSeal. Primary efficacy endpoints were units of transfused red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma and platelet concentrates, and duration of intensive care unit stay. Secondary efficacy endpoints were 48-h blood loss, reoperation for bleeding, mediastinitis, 30-day mortality and duration of hospital stay.\n\nRESULTS: Between March 2009 and January 2012, 1445 patients were randomized. The intention-to-treat (ITT) population comprised 1436 patients; the per-protocol (PP) population 1292. In both the ITT and the PP analysis, no significant difference between the treatment groups was observed for any of the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints. In addition, no significant difference between the groups was seen in the proportion of transfused patients. Estimated CryoSeal costs were 822 (95 per cent c.i. 808 to 836) per patient, which translated to 72,000 per avoided transfusion (unbounded 95 per cent c.i.).\n\nCONCLUSION: The use of the fibrin sealant CryoSeal did not result in health benefits. Combined with the high cost per avoided transfusion, this study does not support the implementation of routine CryoSeal use in elective isolated CABG.\n\nREGISTRATION NUMBER: NTR1386 ( http://www.trialregister.nl).\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2015 BJS Society Ltd Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",

Compared to the SoC group, the FP group showed better hemostasis at 10 min post-randomization [58/59 (98.3 %) vs. 28/32 (87.5 %); P = 0.01], lower mean time to hemostasis (6.1 +/- 13.5 vs. 17.8 +/- 32.0 min), and a less frequent need for re-treatment (5.1 vs. 53.1 %). The triangular test for binary response demonstrated the FP to be superior to SoC (95 % CI 1.474-3.290; P < 0.0001). Safety profiles in both groups were similar to those typically observed after long-duration surgery.\n\nCONCLUSION: The FP is safe and superior to SoC for controlling challenging severe soft-tissue bleeding encountered during intra-abdominal and thoracic surgical procedures.",

    "has_full_text": "no",
    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Fibrin glue is used commonly during cardiac surgery but can behave as an intracardiac abnormal foreign body following surgery. There have been few such cases reported, and they were typically noticed only because of the resulting catastrophic cardiac conditions, such as valvular malfunction. We report a case where, for the first time, transesophageal echocardiography was used to detected fibrin glue that was adherent to the ventricular side of a patient's aortic valve immediately after aortic declamping.\n\nCASE PRESENTATION: A 45-year-old Japanese man with Marfan syndrome underwent an aortic valve-sparing operation to treat moderate aortic valve regurgitation resulting from enlargement of his right coronary cusp. Fibrin glue was lightly applied to the suture line between the previous and new grafts. Transesophageal echocardiography performed prior to weaning from the cardiopulmonary bypass revealed mild aortic valve regurgitation in addition to a mobile membranous structure attached to the ventricular side of his aortic valve. It was identified as fibrin glue. We resolved the regurgitation by removing the fibrin glue and repeating the aortic cusp plication. The patient had no complications during recovery.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Fibrin glue can act as an intracardiac foreign body and lead to a potentially fatal embolism. We demonstrated the use of transesophageal echocardiography to detect a fibrin glue-derived intracardiac abnormal foreign body and to confirm its removal. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case where fibrin glue adherent to the aortic valve was detected by transesophageal echocardiography. These findings demonstrate the importance of using transesophageal echocardiography during cardiac surgery that involves using biological glues.",

In cases of uncontrolled air leaks at the second sealing test, fibrin glue was used to fill the residual lesion between the fat and visceral pleura. Fifty-one eligible patients were enrolled in this study to evaluate the duration of postoperative air leaks and the condition of the implanted fat on chest computed tomography (CT) 6 months later.\n\nRESULTS: The mean duration of postoperative air leaks was 1.05 +/- 1.84 days in the 39 cases that received the pericardial fat covering technique only and 2.66 +/- 3.42 days in the 12 cases that received the pericardial fat covering technique combined with fibrin glue. Prolonged alveolar air leaks occurred in 1 case and 2 cases, respectively. No cases required conversion to conventional methods, and there were no further adverse events. On follow-up chest CT approximately 62.7% of obvious engrafted fat survived.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Using free pericardial fat pads as a sealant to control air leaks in pulmonary resection is safe and has good feasibility and potent efficacy. This new method can be an innovative technique for preventing prolonged air leaks.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2015 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

After the operations, none of the possible complications such as cerebrospinal fluid leak, seroma, hematoma, skin necrosis, deep or superficial infection, and wound breakdown was observed.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The usage of the bovine pericardial patch and fibrin sealant technique at the fascial level-between the dural sac and the skin-provides adequate soft tissue coverage in meningomyelocele repair surgery.",

Computed tomography and aortography however showed pericardic effusion and thrombosis situated in the iliac bifurcation of the aorta. During the emergency operation, acute tamponade required sub-xyphoid drainage. The haemodynamic situation was reestablished and the operation continued but within minutes a cataclysmal haemorrhage occurred through the drainage tube due to ischaemic rupture of the lateral wall of the heart into the pericardium. Extra-corporal circulation was installed immediately and a large polytetrafluoroethylene patch was sutured to the epicardium, distally from the necrosed area, in healthy tissue. A biological fibrin glue was injected under the patch. The operation was terminated with an axillo-bifemoral bypass. The postoperative period was satisfactory and the patient was discharged. At the six months examination, the patient was in NYHA class II and the echography showed moderate left ventricular dysfunction with grade II mitral regurgitation and a false aneurysm facing the area of necrosis. This technique allowed us to patch the rupture without excessive tension on the sutures in the fragile tissue which would have increased the risk of secondary rupture. In addition, the large patch avoided excessive reduction in volume of the left ventricular cavity and saved the mitral chordae which would have been destroyed by direct suture. This method can be an effective salvage technique for heart rupture during the acute phase of myocardial infarction and offers the possibility of a second look in case of a secondary false aneurysm.",

Injectable cardiac tissue engineering aims to support cell-based therapies and enhance their efficacy for cardiac diseases. So far, no research has been devoted to studying the usefulness of the combination of fibrin glue (as scaffold) and adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) to treat myocardial infarction. In our study, the rat ADSCs were isolated from subcutaneous adipose tissues. The surface phenotype of these cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. The fibrin glue was then co-injected with ADSCs into the left ventricular wall of rat infarction models. The structure and functional consequences of transplantation were determined by detailed histological analysis and echocardiography. Most cultured ADSCs expressed CD105 and CD90, and were negative for CD34 and CD45. After injection, both the 24-h cell retention and four-week graft size were significantly higher and larger in the Fibrin + ADSCs group than those of the ADSCs group alone (P < 0.01). The heart function improved significantly in the Fibrin + ADSCs group compared with that of the ADSCs group four weeks after transplantation (P < 0.01). In addition, the arteriole densities within the infarcted area improved significantly in the Fibrin + ADSCs group compared with those in the ADSCs group four weeks after transplantation (P < 0.01). In conclusion, the ADSCs with the fibrin glue has the therapeutic potential to improve the function of infarcted hearts.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Postoperative atrial fibrillation remains a common cause of morbidity. Although epicardial drug delivery can increase efficacy and reduce side effects, it is impractical for postoperative atrial fibrillation because pericardial bleeding/effusion and drainage cause rapid drug elimination. Fibrin glue sprayed on the epicardium is vigorously adherent, allowing an admixed drug to remain in contact with the heart. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate a novel corticosteroid-fibrin glue mixture applied to the atrial epicardium at the time of surgery for prevention of postoperative atrial tachyarrhythmias.\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Talc was instilled into the pericardium in 15 dogs to simulate postoperative inflammation. Pacemakers were implanted to monitor arrhythmias. A mixture of triamcinolone and fibrin glue (Tisseel) was sprayed onto the atria of the treatment animals (n=9), whereas control animals (n=6) received Tisseel or nothing. After 1 week, pacemaker interrogation quantified postoperative atrial tachyarrhythmias (atrial rate >200 bpm) burden. Excised hearts underwent histological examination and tensile strength testing. postoperative atrial tachyarrhythmias occurred in 100% of control animals but only 33% of treatment animals (P=0.027). The median time (25th percentile, 75th percentile) in tachycardia was 5.5 hours (2.7, 12.6) per day in the control group, compared with 0 hours (0, 0.2) in the treatment group (P=0.001). Severe inflammation was present in 6 of 6 control animals and 1 of 9 treatment animals (P=0.001). The tensile strength of a healing left atriotomy was not significantly different between groups. Steroid levels at the time the animals were killed were very low (median of 0.22 mug/dL [0.18, 0.23]).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: A mixture of triamcinolone and fibrin glue sprayed onto the atria reduced postoperative atrial tachyarrhythmias and reduced inflammatory cell infiltration. There was no change in the tensile strength of a healing atriotomy and plasma steroid levels were low. Clinical trials of this approach are warranted.",

Preoperative risk scores for SSI were 9.9+/-4.3 and 9.7+/-4.0 (P=0.747) for the microbial sealant and the control group, respectively, and combined preoperative-intraoperative risk scores were 9.7+/-4.1 and 8.7+/-3.5 (P=0.080), respectively. Carotid artery disease (P=0.019), congestive heart failure (P=0.019), acute myocardial infarction (P=0.001) and emergency surgery (P=0.026) were significantly more common in the microbial sealant group. Follow-up was 100% for both groups. Superficial or deep sternal infection 30 days post surgery developed in seven patients (7.8%) in the control group compared with one patient (1.1%) in the microbial sealant group (odds ratio 7.5). In summary, the inclusion of microbial sealant in preoperative patient preparation seems to reduce the incidence of SSI following CABG surgery; further larger studies are needed before firm conclusions can be drawn.",

Echocardiographic results at 5 weeks after injection of alginate demonstrated persistent improvement of left ventricular fractional shortening and prevention of a continued enlargement of left ventricular dimensions, whereas fibrin glue demonstrated no progression of left ventricular negative remodeling. There was increased arteriogenesis in both the alginate and fibrin glue groups compared with that seen in the phosphate-buffered saline control group. Infarct size was significantly reduced in the fibrin group (P < .05), and there was a trend toward a smaller myocardial infarction in the alginate group.\n\nCONCLUSION: Intramyocardially injected polymers can be used to reshape the aneurysmal left ventricle and might therefore be an approach for myocardial reconstruction and a potential option in treating chronic heart failure in human subjects.",

Although they are considered to be clinically safe, we performed a retrospective analysis of our data to examine the possible side effects of Tissucol fibrin sealant, namely the acute thrombosis of grafts and native coronary arteries resulting in severe myocardial damage and patient deaths.\n\nMETHODS: The data of 2716 patients (2001 male, 715 female) who received an aortocoronary bypass operation from November 1995 to December 1999 were studied retrospectively. Two groups (group 1: received Tissucol, group 2: no sealant used) were compared with respect to an a priori selected set of demographic and clinical variables and with respect to their effect on the outcome using bivariate tabulation. Multiple exploratory assessments of factors possibly related to fatal outcome were done by multiple logistic regression.\n\nRESULTS: Nine hundred ninety patients (group 1) received Tissucol, 1726 patients (group 2) did not receive it. Mean patient age was 64+/-9.1 years. Group 1 had a higher risk of death (7.8% vs 2.8%, p<0.001). The peak values of creatine kinase >500 and creatine kinase-myocardial band >50 were higher in group 1 than in group 2, p<0.001. Adjusted odds ratios for the risk of fatal outcome were: 2.01 for the use of Tissucol, 2.71 for patient age >70 years, 2.02 for aortic cross clamp time >90 min, 3.95 for postoperative ventricular fibrillation, 6.35 for postoperative cardiopulmonary resuscitation, 4.55 for postoperative aortocoronary reoperation.\n\nCONCLUSION: In our analysis an increased risk of myocardial injury or even death was found in coronary artery bypass grafting patients when Tissucol fibrin sealant was used intraoperatively.",

    "abstract": "To analyze the benefits of prosthetic valve sewing ring sealing with antibiotic and fibrin glue in endocarditis, a prospective study was undertaken in 16 consecutive patients. Valvular lesions concerned aortic valve in seven patients, mitral valve in three and both in six. Preoperative antibiotic treatment was started 15+/-15 days before surgery. Peroperative findings showed six isolated valvular lesions and ten perivalvular extensions. Before the prostheses were sutured to the annulus, the Dacron sewing rings were covered with antibiotic and fibrin glue. The antibiotic was chosen according to the micro-organism identified preoperatively. We didn't have any peroperative mortality or paravalvular leakage (PVL). One patient died suddenly on postoperative day (POD) nine (non-contributive autopsy). Another patient was reoperated on POD 31 for PVL. Peroperative local bacteriological examinations were sterile. Mean follow-up was of 9.3+/-6.8 months and was completed in all cases. Actuarial survival rate was 94+/-6% and freedom from reoperation was 92+/-7%. Antibiotic treatment was stopped after 59+/-64 days for 10 patients. None of them had recurrence of endocarditis or PVL. Prosthetic valve sewing ring sealing with adapted antibiotic and fibrin glue can constitute a good weapon in the armamentarium of surgical treatment of active endocarditis.",

A next generation fibrin sealant (TISSEEL VH S/D) has been developed in frozen, ready-to-use form with an added virus inactivation step (solvent/detergent [S/D] treatment) to provide added safety and convenience to the currently licensed product. This study was performed to compare efficacy and safety of the two products.\n\nMETHODS: Phase 3, prospective, randomized, double-blind, multicenter study to compare TISSEEL VH S/D to TISSEEL VH during cardiac surgery. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved hemostasis at the primary treatment site within 5 min, and maintained hemostasis until surgical closure.\n\nRESULTS: The proportion of patients who achieved hemostasis at the primary treatment site within 5 min, and maintained hemostasis until surgical closure was 88.2% for TISSEEL VH S/D and 89.6% for TISSEEL VH in the intent-to-treat population. The difference in proportions, TISSEEL VH S/D minus TISSEEL VH, was 1.4% with a standard error of 3.70%. The lower 97.5% confidence bound of this difference was 8.6%, which is above the predefined noninferiority margin of 15%. Therefore, TISSEEL VH S/D is at least as efficacious as TISSEEL VH. The safety profile of TISSEEL VH S/D was very similar to that of currently licensed TISSEEL VH as assessed by the safety endpoints.\n\nCONCLUSION: TISSEEL VH S/D is safe and effective for use as an adjunct to hemostasis in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.",

Cellular transplantation techniques are, however, limited by transplanted cell retention and survival within the ischemic tissue.\n\nMETHODS: The left coronary artery of rats was occluded for 17 min followed by reperfusion. One week later, bovine serum albumin (BSA), fibrin glue, skeletal myoblasts in BSA, or skeletal myoblasts in fibrin glue were injected into the infarcted area of the left ventricle. The animals were euthanized five weeks after injection, and their hearts were excised, fresh frozen, and sectioned for histology and immunohistochemistry.\n\nRESULTS: After five weeks, the mean area covered by skeletal myoblasts in fibrin glue was significantly greater than the area covered by myoblasts injected in BSA. Myoblasts within the infarct were often concentrated around arterioles. The infarct scar size and myoblasts in the fibrin group were significantly smaller than those in the control and BSA groups. Fibrin glue also significantly increased the arteriole density in the infarct scar as compared with the control group.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that fibrin glue increases cell transplant survival, decreases infarct size, and increases blood flow to ischemic myocardium. Therefore, fibrin glue may have potential as a biomaterial scaffold to improve cellular cardiomyoplasty treat and MIs.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: From animal and clinical studies it is known that prevention of 'over-distention' of vein grafts by using extravascular support ameliorates the arterialization process in vein grafts with subsequent more favorable patency. The most ideal support is a biodegradable, porous, elastic graft (Biomaterials, 15 (1994) 83). However, a specific graft meeting these criteria is not available yet. Fibrin glue on the other hand, although used for other purposes in cardiac surgery, theoretically meets the criteria for ideal extravascular support. In this ex vivo study, we evaluated the possible beneficial effect of perivenous application of fibrin glue.\n\nMETHODS: Segments of human vein graft obtained during CABG procedures in 14 consecutive patients were placed in a side loop of the extracorporeal perfusion circuit. In this way the study vein grafts did meet identical circumstances as the vein grafts implanted. Perfusion in the loop was started with a flow just enough to counteract the collapse of the vein, usually about 8 mm Hg, and alternately around the segments fibrin glue was applied or no perivenous support was administered as control. After 1 min of soldification, perfusion was started with a pressure of about 60 mm Hg (non-pulsatile flow). Perfusion was maintained for 60 min, after which the grafts were collected for light microscopic and electron microscopic assessment.\n\nRESULTS: Light microscopy and electron microscopy showed remarkable attenuation of endothelial cell loss and less injury of smooth muscle cells of the circular muscle layer of the media in the fibrin glue supported vein grafts compared to the non-supported group.\n\nCONCLUSION: Fibrin glue is able to accomplish adequate external vein graft support, preventing overdistention, in an ex vivo model. This provides a basis for clinical application. Further investigation is necessary to evaluate long-term effects.",

Our aim was to examine the formation of aprotinin-specific antibodies with regard to the application mode.\n\nMETHODS: Sera of 150 patients who had undergone cardiac operations and were receiving aprotinin therapy for the first time were sampled before the operation and at medians of 3.5 and 13.3 months after the operation. Aprotinin-specific IgG including all subgroups and aprotinin-specific IgE were analyzed. Aprotinin was given locally (as contained in fibrin sealant; n = 45; median dose, 6000 KIU), intravenously (n = 46; 2.000 x 10(6) KIU), and combined (n = 59; 2.012 x 10(6) KIU).\n\nRESULTS: At 3.5 months, the prevalence of aprotinin-specific IgG antibodies was 33% (15/45 patients) after local, 28% (13/46 patients) after intravenous, and 69% (41/59 patients) after combined exposure (P =.0001).

Total aprotinin dose was similar in patients who were antibody positive and negative. Before the operation, no aprotinin-specific antibodies were detected. Aprotinin-specific IgE were not found after the operation.\n\nCONCLUSION: Local aprotinin contact induces a specific immune response and reinforces that of intravenous exposure. The antibody spectrum is identical to the immune response induced by intravenous exposure. Any exposure should be documented. For use in cardiac operations as a hemostyptic, the necessity itself and alternatives for aprotinin as a stabilizing agent merit consideration.",

Surgical procedures broken down by group were as follows: Group 1: 4 CABG, 5 valvular surgeries and 2 other. Group 2: 11 CABG, 6 valvular surgery, 4 other. We preserved the patient's own blood and stored pure red cell and fresh frozen plasma (FFP).

All patients received aprotinin only topically as contained in fibrin sealant. Serum samples were drawn preoperatively, 1 week, 2 weeks, 6 weeks, and approximately 1 year after operation. They were analyzed for aprotinin-specific immunoglobulin G antibodies with a standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and a fluorescence enzyme immunoassay for aprotinin-specific immunoglobulin E antibodies.\n\nRESULTS: At 1 week, 2 weeks, 6 weeks, and 1 year, we found prevalences of 8% (2 of 26), 8% (2 of 24), 6% (3 of 49), and 0% for aprotinin-specific Immunoglobulin E, and for aprotinin-specific immunoglobulin G 8% (2 of 26), 17% (4 of 24), 39% (19 of 49), and 12% (5 of 41).

Any use of aprotinin must be carefully documented. If aprotinin use is planned in patients who previously underwent a surgical procedure, preexposure to aprotinin in any form must be sought to avoid unexpected anaphylactic reactions.

Although the GRFG glue slowed bleeding significantly at both sites compared to baseline, it did not provide total control. The control group required additional sutures to control bleeding. The cryoprecipitate glue and the two-component fibrin sealant provided a satisfactory clot in 3 to 4 seconds on the epicardium, whereas the GRFG glue generated a poor clot. There were minimal adhesions in the subpericardial space in the cryoprecipitate and the two-component fibrin sealant groups, whereas moderate-to-dense adhesions were present in the GRFG glue group at 6 weeks. The two-component fibrin sealant was completely reabsorbed by 10 days, but cryoprecipitate and GRFG glues were still present. On histologic examination, both fibrin glues exhibited minimal tissue reaction; in contrast, extensive fibroblastic proliferation was caused by the GRFG glue. The two-component and GRFG glues had outstanding adhesive property; in contrast, the cryoprecipitate glue did not show any adhesive power. The GRFG glue had a significantly greater tensile strength than the two-component fibrin sealant. Random samples from both cryoprecipitate and the two-component fibrin glue were free of hepatitis and retrovirus.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The GRFG glue should be used as a tissue reinforcer; the two-component fibrin sealer is preferable when hemostatic action must be accompanied with mechanical barrier; and finally, the cryoprecipitate glue can be used when hemostatic action is the only requirement.",

Fibrin glue are indicated in surgery to improve hemostasis when conventional techniques such as compression, sutures or electrocoagulation are insufficient. Through this study, we tried to study the contribution of fibrin glue to the improvement of the clinical parameters (volume of postoperative bleeding, length of stay in intensive care, volume of blood transfusion ...) in two populations having undergone cardiac surgery, one in which we used the fibrin glue and one without fibrin glue.This was a retrospective cohort study conducted in the cardiovascular surgery department of our Hospital in Rabat between June 2012 and June 2015. Fibrin glue (Tissucol\u00ae of BAXTER) was used in one group with an haemostatic aim. The pre and post-operative clinical data of the patients were analyzed and compared with data from patients who were operated without the use of fibrin glue because it was not yet available in the hospital. The clinical parameters were collected analyzed using the SPSS 13.0 software.One hundred ten patients were included in this study. The fibrin glue was used intraoperatively in 55 patients and not used in 55 patients. 43 (39.1%) had cyanogenic diseases and 67 (60.9%) had non-cyanogenic pathologies. The volume of transfused red blood cells was lower in patients in whom we used biological glue (p\u2009=\u20090.005), as well as the number of days spent in intensive care (p\u2009=\u20090.02). However, the difference was not significant between the two groups for other parameters such as bleeding volume per kg, the number of units of fresh frozen plasma and the platelet units count transfused.The results we found show that fibrin glue reduces the duration of hospitalization in resuscitation and reduces the number of units of transfused red blood cells to patients after surgery. However, it does not reduce significantly the total postoperative bleeding volume per weight, the number of fresh frozen plasma units or platelets units transfused. The fibrin glue could therefore be of moderate benefit in pediatric cardiac surgery.Cardiovascular surgery in children is a surgical procedure with a high risk of haemorrhage. This is due to several parameters: 1) cardiothomy: approach to large vessels (aorta and vena cava), 2) the technique used: Extracorporeal circulation induces hemodilution, depletion of coagulation factors, platelet dysfunction. The consequence of these elements is the occurrence of significant postoperative bleeding and pathophysiological abnormalities 3) the patient\u2019s low age; and 4) the low blood volume of the patients, ie any bleeding could represent an emergency situation for the surgical team.Hemostasis is an important physiological procedure for healing wounds and minimizing bleeding, this procedure achieved through the successive stages of physiological coagulation. Rapid and efficient haemostasis is very important for most patients as well as for the medical profession and the health system in general, especially to health insurance funds that reimburse patients. In surgical practice, bleeding control pre- and intra-operative reduces significant blood loss and thus helps to minimize postoperative complications of bleeding (eg, transfusion with associated risk) [1], postoperative infection [2], prolonged hospital stay times).The use of some fibrin-based biological glues is associated with significant improvement in patients with some heart problems [3]. Biological glue has been widely used in Europe in several surgical procedures, including cardiovascular surgery [4]. Its use has been associated with several advantages such as reduced operating time, minimization of localized bleeding, reduction of postoperative blood loss and reduction of the incidence of surgical revision following bleeding [5]. Fibrin glue is used in cardiovascular surgery for several reasons: tissue sealing to control difficult bleeding on vascular anastomoses, promote hemostasis in patients under heparin, the use of highly porous vascular grafts, control of residual bleeding after embolization and surgical resection and during surgical operations to treat congenital heart defects [6] it also facilitates thrombosis of an expanding abdominal aortic aneurysm [7].Conventional methods are generally used to properly control bleeding that occurs during cardiovascular surgeries. Unfortunately, these means are often associated with prolonged duration of intervention and persistent hemorrhages. They may also be associated with cardiovascular instability that may increase perioperative morbidity and mortality [8].The use of biological sealants has been promoted primarily based on their ability to enhance coagulation in addition to their capacity to create a mechanical barrier at the site of bleeding [9].The objective of our work is to study the contribution of fibrin glue to the improvement of the clinical parameters in the surgery of cyanogenic and non-cyanogenic congenital cardiopathies, especially volume of postoperative bleeding, length of stay in intensive care, volume of blood derivatives transfusion in two populations having undergone cardiac surgery, one in which we used the fibrin glue and one without fibrin glue.This was a retrospective cohort study conducted between January 2012 and December 2015 in the Pediatric Cardiovascular Surgery Unit at the International University Hospital Cheikh Zaid in Rabat.We compared two groups of patients operated by the same team to treat congenital heart diseases. The first group was operated for congenital heart disease without the use of fibrin glue and the second group using the fibrin glue after its introduction to the hospital.The pre- and post-operative clinical data of the patients were analyzed. The hospital information system was used for this purpose. The main parameters and indicators analyzed were: the volume of post-operative bleeding, the use of blood transfusion and its derivatives, and the length of stay in intensive care inpatients.Continuous variables are expressed as either a mean or median and categorical variables are expressed as a percentage. The comparison was made using the non-parametric tests of Mann Whitney or the Student test. Correlations were also made to compare the quantitative variables. The statistical analysis was done using the SPSS 13.0 software.One hundred ten patients were included in this study (20 patients were excluded because we did not have complete data in their medical records, 9 in the group of fibrin glue and 11 in the group without fibrin glue). The fibrin glue was used intraoperatively in 55 patients and not used in 55 patients. 43 (39.1%) had cyanogenic diseases and 67 (60.9%) had non-cyanogenic pathologies. The median age of our population is 405\u2009days [180\u20131822.5]. Inter ventricular communication, atrioventricular duct and Tetralogy of Fallot, are the most frequent congenital cardiopathies in our series (24.5, 22.7, 21.8% respectively). The demographic and clinical characteristics of the study population are summarized in Table\u00a01.Table 1Demographic and clinical characteristics of the study populationCriterionWith fibrin glueWithout fibrin gluepSex0.28\u2003F22 (40%)26 (47.3%)\u2003M33 (60%)29 (52.7%)Age (median in day)360 [180\u20132160]510 [210\u20131800]0.60Weight (median in kg)7.7 [5\u201315]9.2 [6\u201315]0.32Type of pathology0.35\u2003cyanogenic20 (36.4%)23 (41.8%)\u2003Non-cyanogenic35 (63.6%)32 (58.2%)Total bleeding volume (median in mL)132 [70\u2013200]118 [80\u2013220]0.96bleeding volume/kg (median in mL/kg)14.1 [10\u201324.3]15.6 [7\u201321]0.39Length of stay in intensive care2 [2\u20133]3 [2\u20134]0.02Number of units of transfused red blood cells2 [2\u20133]3 [2\u20133]0.005Number of units of fresh plasma frozen transfusion3 [2\u20133]2.9 [3\u20133]0.48Number of units of platelets transfused0 [0\u20132]0 [0\u20130]0.39Demographic and clinical characteristics of the study populationThe volume of transfused red blood cells units was lower in patients in whom we used fibrin glue (2 vs 3\u2009units, p\u2009=\u20090.005), as well as the number of days spent in intensive care (2 vs 3\u2009days, p\u2009=\u20090.02). However, the difference was not significant between the two groups for other parameters such as bleeding volume per kg (14.1 vs 16\u2009ml/kg, p\u2009=\u20090.39), the number of units of fresh frozen plasma (3 vs 3\u2009units, p\u2009=\u20090.48) and the platelet units transfused (1 vs 0.7, p\u2009=\u20090.39).The volume of bleeding increases with age significantly (r\u2009=\u20090.455, p\u2009<\u20090.001), with weight (r\u2009=\u20090.369, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and with CEC time (r\u2009=\u20090.281, p\u2009=\u20090.003).Although the safety of hemostatic fibrin sealants and their efficacy in reducing blood loss has been demonstrated [10, 11], there is a relative shortage of prospective clinical trials, particularly in pediatric cardiac surgery [12].For pediatric cardiac surgery, the need for perfect hemostasis is even greater due to the high incidence of coagulopathy following open-heart procedures [13] and increased risks associated with the use of blood and blood products.Our series is the largest series that has dealt with this subject at the national level and one of the largest at the international level. Fibrin glue was not available on the Moroccan market before 2012. After several requests, BAXTER took charge of the importation of the product and its introduction on the national market.We tried to study the contribution of fibrin glue \u201cTissucol\u00ae\u201d in patients who underwent cardiovascular surgery for congenital heart disease by comparing some clinical parameters between the two groups. The selected indicators are those found in the literature and are related to the bleeding and indications for fibrin glue. Bleeding by weight, hospital stay in intensive care after surgery, number of transfused units of red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma and platelet, all of these parameters were investigated and compared between both groups.The results of our study are broadly similar to those in the literature. Thus, we found that the use of fibrin glue allowed the reduction of the number of units of red blood cells transfused to the patients after surgery, it also made it possible to reduce the stay of hospitalization in intensive care after surgery. However, the result that remains contradictory with those found in the literature is the insignificant difference in the volume of bleeding between the two groups. This is probably due to the difference between the two groups regarding demographic characteristics and the type of pathologies and surgery.Twenty-four trials have been reported by Kjaergard and Fairbrother about the use of fibrin adhesives in cardiac surgery. Four studies reported no difference and 20 trials reported positive results in decreased bleeding [14]. Furthermore, Lamm et al. reported several cases of acute occlusion when the \u201cTissucol\u00ae\u201d fibrin glue was used near the anastomoses. This requires considerable caution when using this product [15]. Other randomized controlled trials compared the use of a variety of topical hemostatic agents with variable efficacy and varying degrees of evidence in favor of their benefits [5, 12, 16\u201322].Huth et al. reported that fibrin glue \u201cTissucol\u00ae\u201d was used for local hemostasis in 21 patients undergoing Fallot tetralogy correction (ToF) and in 10 patients undergoing a Senning procedure in transposition of major arteries (TGA). The authors compared postoperative blood loss to 20 ToF patients and 10 TGA patients who had a correction one year ago without fibrin glue and found that two hours after surgery, bleeding with fibrin glue was lower than without fibrin glue (p\u2009<\u20090.01) in patients with ToF and TGA. Over the next 18\u2009h, the secretion of thoracic drains was identical in both groups [23]. This result could be considered similar to our result since the overall bleeding volume is similar in both groups. It is likely that fibrin glue only reduces anastomotic bleeding, and after the first couple of hours most of the ongoing blood loss is related to the sternum and to the large raw surface in the mediastinum, which is identical in both groups.Cyanogenic pathologies, mainly transposition of large vessels, Fallot\u2019s tetralogy, obstacles to the outflow pathway and pulmonary atresia are pathologies that cause more bleeding due to the pathophysiological mechanism of these pathologies and the large number of stitches and arterial remodeling performed. In almost all cases, cardiovascular surgeons use biological glue after sutures and anastomoses. In addition to the hemostatic effect reported in all the above studies, this may have a reassuring effect for the surgical and anesthetist team.In the case of non-cyanogenic pathologies, for example inter-ventricular communication (IVC), inter-auricular communication (IAC), the atrio-auricular canal (CAV), the risk of bleeding is less than that of cyanogenic pathologies and the use of the biological glue is subject to the appreciation of the surgical team.Codispoti et al. have showed, in a randomized controlled trial in pediatric cardiac surgery with coagulopathy, that there was a significant reduction in the use of blood products and time spent in the operating room to achieve hemostasis when the fibrin glue was used [12].We can thus deduce from the above that fibrin glues are mainly used in cardiovascular and cardiothoracic surgery as an adjunct to haemostasis, their effectiveness is reported and confirmed by several teams [24]. Fibrin adhesives are also used in cardiovascular surgery to seal sutures, baselines, anastomoses, fistulas and injured surfaces [25].This study has three limitations. The first is that it is a retrospective study with all of the risks and bias associated with that type of studies. The second concerns the demographic characteristics (age and weight) of the two populations even if the difference is not significant (p\u2009=\u20090.60, p\u2009=\u20090.32 respectively), and the third concerns the distribution of the pathologies (cyanogenic and non-cyanogenic) in each group of patients even if the difference is not significant (p\u2009=\u20090.35).In pediatric cardiac surgery, bleeding represents a dangerous situation that can complicate the surgical procedure and the post-operative follow-up especially in cyanogenic pathologies and pathologies requiring a significant number of sutures and remodeling.Fibrin sealants can reduce postoperative complications by promoting hemostasis and the avoidance of blood loss. The reduction in hemorrhage also reduces the need for blood transfusions, which may lead to a reduced risk of viral infection.Atrio-auricular canalInter-auricular communicationInter-ventricular communicationTransposition of major arteriesFallot tetralogy correctionThe authors wish to thank all the individuals and institutions that made this study possible especially the hospital cardiac surgery team.AC: Head of pharmacy of Cheikh Zaid Hospital, Rabat, Morocco.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Modern echocardiography now allows for the detection of a substantial number of residual ventricular septal defects (VSDs) after surgical patch repair that remained hidden in the past. Mostly without hemodynamic significance, residual VSDs may have clinical consequences (progressive dehiscence, hemolysis, prophylactic antibiotic treatment, endocarditis). To reduce the number and size of residual VSDs we performed an experimental and a clinical study.\n\nMETHODS: (1) In an experimental setup, burst pressure of 60 fibrin glue-sealed defects (calibrated between 1.0 and 5.0 mm in diameter) was determined using a computerized recording system and pressure loads up to 500 mm Hg. (2) In a prospective clinical trial with blinded postoperative echocardiographic controls VSD closure was performed in 36 consecutive patients (age, 37 +/- 40 months; range, 4 to 134 months) using a polytetrafluoroethylene patch and running sutures reinforced with pledgets (22 of 36 patients) or sealed with fibrin glue (14 of 36 patients) in accordance to the surgeon's preference.\n\nRESULTS: (1) Experimentally, mean pressure load achieved was more than 500 +/- 0 mm Hg for 1.0-mm defects, 413 +/- 52 mm Hg for 2.5-mm defects, 363 +/- 58 mm Hg for 4.0-mm defects, and 313 +/- 48 mm Hg for 5.0-mm defects (r 0.873, p < 0.001). (2) Clinically, all patients survived. Residual VSDs at echocardiography were observed in 16 of 22 patients (72%) for reinforced versus 5 of 14 patients (36%) for sealed with fibrin glue (p < 0.05). Diameter of residual VSDs accounted for 1.3 +/- 1.2 mm for reinforced versus 0.3 +/- 0.4 mm for sealed with fibrin glue (p < 0.01). Hemodynamically significant residual VSDs were fond in 2 of 22 patients (9%) for reinforced versus 0 of 14 patients (0%) for sealed with fibrin glue (p = not significant).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Small defects sealed with fibrin glue resist physiologic pressure load. Fibrin glue sealing of prosthetic patches during intracardiac VSD repair allows for significant reduction of number and size of residual VSDs. Improved long-term outcome can be expected.",

    "abstract": "The closure of multiple ventricular septal defects remains a surgical challenge. Mortality and morbidity are high. Left ventricular incision and multiple patches or stitches impair septal motion and function. We searched for a method that would cause minimal left ventricular and septal dysfunction. The use of fibrin seal for closing ventricular septal defects was considered. The method was first tested in animals so as to assess the internal resistance of the fibrin seal to stretching and fragmentation in addition to its adhesiveness and hence the absence of left-to-right embolization of the fibrin seal clot and the long-term success of the ventricular septal defect closure further to complete resorption of the ventricular septal defect clot. This experimental work was very satisfactory. Between April 1986 and September 1991, 15 children were operated on with the use of this technique. The overall hospital mortality rate was 6%. There were no reoperations for residual ventricular septal defects. All the long-term survivors (n = 13) were in excellent clinical condition with no or trivial residual shunt attested by color flow mapping investigation. This experimental and clinical experience suggests that satisfactory results can be achieved with the use of fibrin seal for the closure of multiple muscular ventricular septal defects.",

    "abstract": "Brief case histories of three patients aged 58, 38, and 44 years are reported. All underwent cardiovascular operations. Subsequently hemostasis test abnormalities developed between the seventh and eighth postoperative days after exposure to bovine thrombin used with fibrin glue. These were characterized by an increased activated partial thromboplastin time (64 to 147 seconds), prothrombin time (19 to 24 seconds), bovine thrombin time (> 120 seconds) and a markedly reduced factor V level (< 10% in two patients and 16% in the third patient). A patient plasma dilution of 1 in 200 with a normal plasma pool was necessary to correct bovine thrombin time. No fast-acting or progressive inhibitor against factor V could be detected by coagulation tests, and fresh frozen plasma perfusion had no effect. Plasmapheresis was performed preventatively to avoid bleeding, and factor V levels stabilized at around 50% after two to four exchanges. Immunologic studies showed that the inhibitors were directed not only against bovine factors but also against human ones. Therefore factor V decrease could have been the result of rapid clearance from the circulation of complexes formed with a nonneutralizing inhibitor that is not detected by clotting tests. These antibodies were purified by standard methods and immunoaffinity. Fast immunization could be explained by a prior sensitization to bovine thrombin exposure during previous operations. It is suggested that bovine thrombin used with fibrin glue contains small amounts of factor V and may be responsible for these abnormalities. This is in agreement with previous literature reports. However, these described neutralizing factor V inhibitors, which were easily detected.",

The patient had previously been exposed twice to topical bovine thrombin contained in fibrin glue during cardiac surgery. TT was normal when human thrombin was used as reagent. The patient's purified IgG reacted with bovine prothrombin and bovine thrombin in immunoblotting studies but showed virtually no cross-reaction with human thrombin. In addition, following surgery, factor V clotting activity (FV:C) was reduced to 9% of normal. The inhibitor of bovine thrombin persisted over a period of more than a year, while the level of FV:C progressively returned to normal within this time period. Development of thrombin and FV:C inhibitors was also investigated in plasma of 34 consecutive patients who had undergone either cardiac surgery or neurosurgery with use of fibrin glue containing bovine thrombin. Eleven of 24 patients after cardiac surgery and two of 10 patients after neurosurgery presented with TT > or = 25 s (normal plasma 15 s). Two patients had been re-exposed to fibrin glue during cardiac re-operation and showed markedly prolonged TT (> 60 s). All 13 patients who had acquired a thrombin inhibitor also had low FV:C activity (10-60% of normal plasma), whereas FV:C activity remained in the normal range in the 21 patients with normal TT. Our findings indicate that development of inhibitors of bovine thrombin as well as co-immunization to factor V occurs frequently and is associated with the amount of applied fibrin glue and with the type of operation. Re-exposure to fibrin glue seems to enhance formation of inhibitors of bovine thrombin and human factor V.",

    "abstract": "The trend toward early operation for acquired ventricular septal defects exposes the patient to major perioperative bleeding and residual shunt because of the fragility of the recently necrosed myocardium. To reduce these complications we have used a fibrin sealant to reinforce the cardiac tissues in addition to the usual closure of the defect with a Dacron patch through a left ventricular septum around the defect, area. During cardiac arrest fibrin sealant is applied on the ventricular septum around the defect, between the septum and the patch, and on the edges of the ventriculotomy. This technique was used in three patients (mean age 68.2 years) operated on for an acquired ventricular septal defect within 4 days of the infarction and within 24 hours of the occurrence of the defect. Low postoperative bleeding, absence of recurrent shunt, and good ventricular function indicated satisfactory surgical result in all three patients. We suggest that the use of fibrin sealant during operations for acquired ventricular septal defects, by reinforcing the necrotic and fragile tissues, may reduce perioperative bleeding and assure a more solid implantation of the patch.",

Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed ring-enhancement lesions in the left parietal lobe and peritumoral cerebral edema associated with a cystic mass lesion [Figure 1].Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance images (a, axial b, coronal) reveal a ring-shaped enhancement in the left parietal lobe and peritumoral cerebral edema associated with a cystic lesionAfter the craniotomy, we determined the tumor cyst location and depth by ultrasonography [Figure 2a]. First, we cauterized the cerebral surface, inserted an 18G needle into the cyst, and aspirated approximately 2 ml of cystic fluid to reduce the volume of the cystic contents. After puncture and aspiration, we reconfirmed the location of the tumor by ultrasonography [Figure 2b]. During the course of the procedure, we extended the incision on the cerebral surface, found the opening into the cystic wall, and then aspirated and evacuated the remaining cystic fluid. We operated with utmost care during the procedure to ensure that there were no leaks onto the cerebral surface. Then, we injected 2 ml of pyoktanin blue into the cyst and waited a few minutes until it had stained the inner wall of the cyst. Then, we aspirated the pyoktanin blue from the cyst and solidified the tumor by injecting fibrin glue sealant (Bolheal\u00ae, Teijin, Japan) into the cyst cavity. This made it easier to grasp the tumor during resection because solidification prevented leakage of the cystic fluid. We introduced a microscope and performed dissection from areas with relatively distinct margins between the areas outside the cystic wall. There were some areas where the margin between the cystic wall and normal brain tissue was indistinct, and a diagnosis of glioblastoma was made by means of rapid intraoperative diagnosis (frozen section analysis). The viscous and grayish-white tumor-like areas were removed with a Cavitron Ultrasonic Surgical Aspirator (CUSA) to achieve macroscopic total resection. 8-sheet Gliadel\u00ae (Eisai, Nobelpharma, Japan), carmustine (BCNU) wafers were placed at the same site, and the cranium was closed. The resected tumor [Figure 3], permanent sections [Figure 4], and MRI image one day after surgery [Figure 5] were observed.Intraoperative echo examination.

(b) Post-punctured cystic tumor is deflated by aspirating its fluid contentsResected tumor: thin cyst wall is well stained of pyoctanin blue (arrow) and fibrin glue is in the tumoral cavity (arrow head)Permanent histopathology is glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).

(b) Atypical cell is presented in the cystic liquid contents by Papanicolaou staining pathology (Class IV)Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance images (a, axial b, coronal) show no contrast tumor as of one day postoperativelyAt 19 months postoperatively, no adverse events due to this procedure were noted, and the clinical course of the patient was favorable with no neurological deficit and no epilepsy noted.Thin cystic walls make dissection difficult during the resection of metastatic cystic brain tumors, and there is a danger that the leakage of cystic fluid will cause dissemination.[4] The disseminated cells are said to have the ability to adhere to tissues and to proliferate, and high numbers of disseminated cells facilitate colonization.[1] In the present case, we did not know whether the preoperative diagnosis was a metastatic or primary brain tumor. However, we employed two techniques during surgery, namely, intracystic injection of pyoktanin blue[7] and cyst solidification.[56] We aspirated the cystic fluid, collapsed the inside of the cyst, stained the cystic wall by using pyoktanin blue, and solidified the cyst lumen with Bolheal\u00ae(Teijin, Japan) fibrin glue sealant. In doing so, we were able to reduce the danger of cystic fluid leakage, and made it easier to grasp the tumor itself, facilitating the dissection of the surrounding areas.The advantage of using pyoktanin blue[7] is that it is a simple and inexpensive technique that allows visualization of the cyst inner wall without damage to the brain tissue. After removing the outer cyst wall and when the staining surface appears, the inner cyst wall can be seen. Because a concentration of 0.01% or higher of pyoktanin blue is desirable, we used 0.2% concentration in the present patient. Pyoktanin blue stains the thin areas of the cystic wall more deeply, however, it does not stain thicker portions of the cystic wall as effectively. When performing dissection of the tumor, as it is less likely for tearing and the leakage of cystic fluid to occur in areas with a thick cystic wall, the fact that pyoktanin blue does not stain these areas well is usually not a problem. In areas where the cystic wall is thin, the cystic wall can rupture easily. We filled the cyst with fibrin glue in advance to reinforce the cystic wall. We were also easily able to recognize damage to the cystic wall, even in areas where the wall was thin because of effective staining with pyoktanin blue. Any anomalies within the cyst would also have become apparent through the use of fibrin glue. The present technique is useful when performing resection of cystic malignant brain tumors with thin walls. However, if suction of the cyst fluid cannot be performed, adaptation of the procedure is difficult, and in the case of multilocular cysts, it is necessary to perform staining for each cyst.Two methods have been reported for solidifying cysts: A method using autologous fibrin glue[5] and another using a hydrofiber dressing.[6] For autologous fibrin glue, cryoprecipitate (6 ml) is extracted from fresh frozen plasma (300 ml), and a 5000-unit vial of thrombin (Mochida, Japan) with physiological saline (7.5 ml) are injected into the cyst to solidify it. Because uniform solidification can be performed even in the case of complex morphology, separation and gripping can be easily performed when the mass is solid. In addition, autologous fibrin glue has been indicated to suppress the growth of enteric bacteria and contribute to the prevention of surgical site infection. Because a large quantity can be collected, it is an effective method when the cyst is large. However, collection of autologous blood is difficult in patients with anemia, and the method is cumbersome and time consuming. Because the cyst was small in the present patient, we used a commercially available fibrin glue product, Bolheal\u00ae (Teijin, Japan), however, other products such as Beriplast P\u00ae (CSL Behring, USA) or TachoSil\u00ae (Takeda, Japan)[3] could have been substituted. Hydrofiber dressing is a material used for covering bedsores; it is a simple and useful method to prevent intraoperative cyst fluid leakage by completely filling the cyst wall through absorption of moisture and absorbing cyst fluid.[6]In the present case, frozen section pathology demonstrated a cystic glioblastoma and not a metastatic cystic brain tumor. To our knowledge, there are no reports concerning dissemination caused by cyst fluid leakage of cystic glioblastoma, nevertheless, the technique described was useful in insuring complete resection of the thin portions of the tumor cyst wall. If a tumor has been solidified by being filled with fibrin glue, the cystic fluid is aspirated, a working space is secured, and the tumor around the cystic wall is dissected away from the normal tissue. In contrast, when the working space is reduced, there is increased compression of the normal tissues, and the surrounding functional cerebral regions may also be affected. However, injection of fibrin glue into the collapsed cyst does not increase the tumor volume remarkably. In the present case, the neighboring cerebral surface was shaped like the tumor, although it was relatively easy to aspirate the cystic fluid and solidify the cyst lumen.With regard to benign brain tumors that form cysts, in the cases of hemangioblastoma and pilocytic astrocytoma, excision of the mural nodule is sufficient and excision of the entire cyst is unnecessary. In addition, the method is difficult to adapt for deep lesions such as Rathkes's cleft cyst, cystic pituitary adenoma, craniopharyngioma and endodermal cyst. Therefore, this method may only be useful for metastatic cystic brain tumors with well-defined borders, and may be limited to comparatively superficial lesions. The technique we used to facilitate resection in this tumor case may also be useful for the management of brain abscess. Regarding the abscess capsule, if the wall is thick and pyoktanin blue staining is generally ineffective, depending on the bacterial species, pyoktanin blue exhibits antibacterial effects;[2] by filling the capsule lumen with fibrin glue, excision can be performed while preventing abscess leakage.Here, we report our experience with an excision method utilizing pyoktanin blue and fibrin glue for a cystic malignant brain tumor. Excision of the tumor as a lump could be performed without leakage of cyst fluid and removal of the cyst wall; this simple method may be a useful technique.Nil.There are no conflicts of interest.The authors thank Dr. Okuda for providing us the documents.\nhttp://surgicalneurologyint.com/Removal-of-a-malignant-cystic-brain-tumor-utilizing-pyoktanin-blue-and-fibrin-glue:-Technical-note/\n",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The extradural temporopolar transcavernous approach can be used to treat central skull base pathologies, but control of bleeding from the opened cavernous sinus is essential. Oxidized cellulose cotton packing and fibrin glue injection can be used, but the effect on the postoperative venous draining pattern remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To investigate changes in the venous drainage pattern immediately after transcavernous surgerywith and without fibrin glue injection into the bleeding cavernous sinus. METHODS: A total of 82 patients treated via the transcavernous approachwere retrospectively divided into 2 groups based on the hemostasis methods. Both pre-And postoperative angiography and/or 3-dimensional computed tomography venography were available for 24 patients in the cotton packing group and 12 patients in the fibrin glue group. RESULTS: Postoperative change in the venous draining pattern was observed in 5 of the 24 patients in the cotton packing group and in 3 of the 12 patients in the fibrin glue group. One of the 82 patients showed postoperative brain swelling due to obstruction of the sphenoparietal sinus. The volume of injected fibrin glue ranged from 0.5 to 2.5 mL (mean, 1.1 +/- 0.5 mL), but none of the patients had brain swelling. CONCLUSION: Direct fibrin glue injection into the opened cavernous sinus is relatively safe, but a change in the venous draining pattern occurs in 25% of patients. The study indicates the potential danger of the change in the venous draining pattern and recommends limiting the injection volume of fibrin glue in transcavernous surgery to avoid complications related to venous congestion.\nCopyright \u00a9 2016 by the Congress of Neurological Surgeons.",

Forty-two male Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups: control group (CG) in which the buccal branch of the facial nerve was collected without injury; (2) experimental group with suture (EGS) and experimental group with fibrin (EGF): The buccal branch of the facial nerve was transected on both sides of the face. End-to-end suture was performed on the right side and fibrin sealant on the left side; (3) Experimental group with suture and laser (EGSL) and experimental group with fibrin and laser (EGFL). All animals underwent the same surgical procedures in the EGS and EGF groups, in combination with the application of LLLT (wavelength of 830 nm, 30 mW optical power output of potency, and energy density of 6 J/cm<sup>2</sup>). The animals of the five groups were euthanized at 5 weeks post-surgery and 10 weeks post-surgery. Axonal sprouting was observed in the distal stump of the facial nerve in all experimental groups. The observed morphology was similar to the fibers of the control group, with a predominance of myelinated fibers. In the final period of the experiment, the EGSL presented the closest results to the CG, in all variables measured, except in the axon area. Both surgical techniques analyzed were effective in the treatment of peripheral nerve injuries, where the use of fibrin sealant allowed the manipulation of the nerve stumps without trauma. LLLT exhibited satisfactory results on facial nerve regeneration, being therefore a useful technique to stimulate axonal regeneration process.\nCopyright \u00a9 2016, Springer-Verlag London.",

    "abstract": "Background: Incomplete nerve regeneration after injuries to the peripheral nervous system remains a significant problem in clinical routine and raises the need for supportive strategies. In this study we examined the effect of an additional fibrin glue conduit in the model of a peripheral nerve defect in the rat treated with an autologous nerve transplant. Materials and Methods: In this study we examined the effect of a custom made fibrin glue conduit as additional nerve guide for an autologous nerve autograft in a 20 mm sciatic nerve defect model. Here a 20 mm segment was resected in the course of the right sciatic nerve of the rat (n = 18) and reversely coapted under the microscope in terms of an autologous interposition. In the experimental group (n = 9) the autograft was additionally incased in nerve guide made of two-compound fibrin glue (ARTISS Fa. Baxter) measuring 25 mm in length, with a 2-mm lumen and 2-mm wall thickness covering both coaptation sites. During the trial period of 16 weeks we conducted walkingtrack and static foot-print-analyses weekly. After 16 weeks the gastrocnemius muscle was weighed. Morphometric evaluation including histology, axon counts and measurement of axonal thickness was carried out 16 weeks post-op. Results: Functional analysis in terms of SFI (sciatic function index) showed significant differences between the groups (p < 0.05) indicating faster functional regeneration in the fibrin glue conduit group. The gastrocnemius muscle's weight was significantly increased (68% vs. 54% of contralateral side; p < 0.05). Conduit-treated animals showed a higher fraction of large axons, while at the same time presenting lower levels of nerve tissue fibrosis in all segments of the operated side. The proportion of large axons as a fraction of the total number of axons was significantly higher in the distal 1/3 of the nerve grafts (p < 0.05) in the conduit group compared to controls. Correspondingly the fraction of small axons was significantly higher in the distal half of nerve grafts in control group. Conclusion: These results indicate the beneficial effect of a custom made fibrin glue nerve guide in addition to microsurgical nerve repair in the model of an autologous nerve transplant in the rat, yet the underlying mechanisms need to be further investigated.",

Mean (+/- standard deviation) leakage pressure was 816 +/- 162 mmH<inf>2</inf>O for atelocollagen sheet (n = 5), significantly higher than the 557 +/- 130 mmH<inf>2</inf>O for PGA sheet (n = 5, p < 0.05, Wilcoxon test). Experiment 2: Bilateral 5 mm bone windows were made in the temporal bone in eight rats. The surgical cavities were filled with one of four materials (fibrin glue only; fibrin glue and atelocollagen sheet; PGA sheet; or autologous fat tissue). Histological changes including the status of implanted materials and inflammatory responses were investigated 2 and 5 weeks after the procedures. Both atelocollagen and PGA sheets remained at 5 weeks after implantation, whereas fibrin glue and fat tissue were absorbed and undetectable at 2 weeks. Inflammatory cell accumulation was less around the atelocollagen sheet compared to the PGA sheet. The combination of atelocollagen sheet and fibrin glue sealant showed sufficient adhesion force and favorable tissue affinity, suggesting this combination as a feasible material in sellar reconstruction.\nCopyright \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",

This was a non-controlled, open-label, multicenter clinical trial. The efficacy evaluation endpoints were (1) GM111's intra-operative capability to close dural defects and (2) prevention of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage and subcutaneous CSF retention throughout the postoperative period (evaluated by diagnostic imaging). Patients meeting the following three preoperative and two intra-operative selection criteria were enrolled: (1) between 12 and <75 years of age; (2) the dura is surmised to be defective and in need of reconstruction; (3) informed written consent was obtained from the patient; (4) the surgical wound is class 1; and (5) the size of duraplasty is >=0.2 cm<sup>2</sup> to <100 cm<sup>2</sup>. Sixty patients were enrolled. The craniotomy site was supratentorial in 77.2%, infratentorial in 12.3% and sellar in 10.5%. The GM111 prosthesis size ranged from 0.24 to 42 cm<sup>2</sup>. To evaluate the efficacy, intra-operative closure was confirmed by Valsalva's maneuver, water infusion, etc., in all patients. CSF leakage and subcutaneous CSF retention throughout the postoperative period were found in four patients. Adverse events for which a causal relationship with GM111 could not be ruled out occurred in 8.8% of the patients. There were no instances of postoperative infection due to GM111. GM111 showed good closure capability and safety when used for non-suture dural closure.

    "abstract": "A polyethylene glycol (PEG) hydrogel sealant recently has been approved as an adjunct to sutured dural closure in Japan. We treated consecutive six patients with PEG hydrogel sealant in posterior fossa operation. Three of six cases suffered delayed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak after watertight dural closure with the PEG hydrogel sealant, although there was no leak case which was treated with fibrin glue, before 2 years until the adoption of the new material. These patients underwent posterior fossa craniotomy and discharged without remarkable CSF leak. The pseudomeningocele under the occipital wound caused the CSF leak occurr from 5th to 7th week postoperatively. All CSF leak cases needed surgical repair. At the repair, the PEG hydrogel was liquefied and almost absorbed. A fistula on the closure line and a dead space after the absorption of the PEG hydrogel was observed. When the absorbable PEG hydrogel sealant plugs in small gaps of sutured dura, its properties to prevent adhesion might suppress healing process of dural closure, so that CSF could leak through the gaps and collect as a pseudomeningocele in the dead space after absorption of the PEG hydrogel. In posterior fossa surgery a PEG hydrogel sealant should be applied when dural edges are closed tightly without any gaps.\nCopyright \u00a9 2014 by The Japan Neurosurgical Society.",

    "abstract": "Lesions to the nervous system often produce hemorrhage and tissue loss that are difficult, if not impossible, to repair. Therefore, scar formation, inflammation and cavitation take place, expanding the lesion epicenter. This significantly worsens the patient conditions and impairment, increasing neuronal loss and glial reaction, which in turn further decreases the chances of a positive outcome. The possibility of using hemostatic substances that also function as a scaffold, such as the fibrin sealant, reduces surgical time and improve postoperative recovery. To date, several studies have demonstrated that human blood derived fibrin sealant produces positive effects in different interventions, becoming an efficient alternative to suturing. To provide an alternative to homologous fibrin sealants, the Center for the Study of Venoms and Venomous Animals (CEVAP, Brazil) has proposed a new bioproduct composed of certified animal components, including a thrombin-like enzyme obtained from snake venom and bubaline fibrinogen. Thus, the present review brings up to date literature assessment on the use of fibrin sealant for nervous system repair and positions the new heterologous bioproduct from CEVAP as an alternative to the commercial counterparts. In this way, clinical and pre-clinical data are discussed in different topics, ranging from central nervous system to peripheral nervous system applications, specifying positive results as well as future enhancements that are necessary for improving the use of fibrin sealant therapy.\nCopyright \u00a9 2017 The Author(s).",

    "abstract": "Introduction Spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) most commonly results from a spontaneous CSF leak. Intracranial hypotension, which is characterized by orthostatic headache, dizziness, tinnitus, and improvement of the symptoms in the supine position, is often encountered in patients with connective tissue disorders. The presence of a pre-existing defect in the dura is a potential cause of SIH. Certain connective tissue disorders are known to be associated with meningeal abnormalities that potentially may lead to dural defects. Meningeal diverticula are known to occur in Marfan's syndrome, Ehler's Danlos syndrome type 2, neurofibromatosis, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, and familial osteosclerosis. Recently in our multidisciplinary pain clinic, we evaluated and treated a patient with an unspecified connective tissue disorder and chronic low pressure headache symptoms in whom initial treatment with an epidural blood patch failed to resolve his symptoms, but successful cessation was ultimately achieved by epidural patching with fibrin glue. Results/Case report We present the case of a 13-year-old Caucasian male with an unspecified connective tissue disorder with Marfanoid features, who met the diagnostic pattern of CSF hypotension with chronic headache and neck pain. Symptoms began in 2011, localized at the junction of the bottom of the skull and neck, in the midline and bilaterally. Intensity was described as 5/10, made worse with sitting up or standing, improved with lying down. The patient described episodes of pain as non-radiating, constant, non-pulsatile, starting in the morning with rising and lasting for 2 days. Conservative treatment consisting of hydration and caffeine provided only mild improvement. The patient's MRI was suggestive of a CSF leak with flattening of the pons and accelerated CSF flow velocity in the cervicothoracic region, but was unable to identify the exact location of a dural tear. Therefore, he underwent empiric epidural blood patching at L3-L4 spinous interspace. The patient reported resolution of his low pressure headache symptoms after his initial intervention. Seven days following the initial epidural blood patch, the patient felt a \"popping\" sensation in his lower back while walking his dog and experienced a return of all symptoms including pain described as 5/10. Discussion Successful treatment of spontaneous intracranial hypotensive symptoms with fibrin glue injection has been reported in post-dural puncture headache in adults secondary to long-term intrathecal catheterization. Additionally, fibrin glue is widely used to achieve watertight dural closure in neurosurgical and orthopedic operations. After failing both conservative measures and epidural blood patch, a fibrin epidural patch was performed in the patient's lumbar spine at the L3-L4 interspace again. The patient's intracranial hypotensive symptoms resolved within the next 24 hours. At his follow-up appointment 1 month later, the patient reported continued resolution of his symptoms. This case is novel as it illustrates that epidural patching with fibrin glue may be a good alternative to autologous epidural blood patching, when epidural blood patching does not result in resolution of the symptoms in a pediatric patient in the setting of an underlying connective tissue disorder.",

Results/Case report We report our observations of 4 pediatric pain patient's with SIH seen over a 6 month period at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital multidisciplinary pain clinic. Patient ages ranged from 11 years to 22 years old (median: 12 years, 6 months). Three patients carried the diagnosis of unspecified connective tissue disorders and concomitant intracranial hypotensive symptoms, notably orthostatic headache, dizziness, tinnitus, and improvement of the symptoms in the supine position. The fourth patient carried the diagnosis of erythromelalgia with severe intractable lower extremity pain requiring periodic intrathecal drug therapy. The three patients with connective tissue disorders failed initial conservative treatment consisting of hydration and caffeine, while the fourth patient had an extensive history of SIH symptoms following intrathecal catheter insertion, and thus underwent prophylactic fibrin epidural patching immediately prior to placement of intrathecal catheter for the purpose of intrathecal drug trial for chronic pain. The duration of SIH symptoms ranged from 1 year to 4 years to (median: 2 years, 6 months). Initial SIH treatment with epidural blood patching at the L4-L5 interspace failed to resolve their symptoms as well, with successful cessation of SIH symptoms were ultimately achieved by epidural patching with fibrin glue at L4-L5 interspace in 3 of the 4 patients. Of the 3 successful interventions, one patient required 2 rounds of fibrin epidural patching to return to her pre-SIH baseline. The patient that failed the fibrin epidural patch treatment eventually experienced resolution of symptoms following a repeat epidural blood patch at the C7-T1 interspace, suggesting a cervicothoracic location as the site of the spontaneous CSF leak. At their 1 month follow-up appointments, the patients reported continued symptom relief and satisfaction with their treatment. Discussion These cases are novel as they illustrate that epidural patching with fibrin glue may be a good alternative to autologous epidural blood patching when blood patching does not result in resolution of the SIH symptoms in connective tissue disorder patients. Additionally, review of the literature shows this to be the first reported case series on the use of fibrin glue for SIH in the pediatric population.",

However, none of these interventions was effective. He was successfully treated by fibrin glue injection into the hematoma cavity after the fifth surgery.This procedure may be effective for refractory CSDH in elderly patients.Chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) is the most common disorder encountered in daily neurosurgical practice, and the incidence increases with higher age.[5] Burr hole craniostomy and irrigation with or without closed drainage is considered to be the first-line treatment with a low rate of complications. However, high postoperative recurrence rates of up to 20% have been reported.[371721] Repeat surgery has been effective in most cases of recurrent CSDH, however, refractory cases require further procedures or other interventions. We successfully treated an elderly patient with refractory CSDH by fibrin glue injection into the hematoma cavity.An 85-year-old male, who had been able to walk with a wheeled walker and had no definitive cognitive problem, was admitted to our hospital because of mild disturbance of consciousness and right hemiparesis. He had no history of head trauma but had been taking oral antiplatelet agent for previous ischemic heart disease. Computed tomography (CT) revealed left CSDH with moderate rightward midline shift [Figure 1, left]. Emergency irrigation and drainage through a left frontal burr hole was performed under local anesthesia. Thick outer membrane was observed during the operation. After removal of the hematoma with irrigation [Figure 1, right], a drainage tube was placed posteriorly. His symptoms disappeared immediately and he was discharged after 12 days. He visited our hospital again because of headache and mild right hemiparesis 8 days after the discharge. CT revealed recurrence of the CSDH [Figure 2, left]. Second irrigation and drainage was performed similar to the first operation. His symptoms improved, however, he was transferred to a rehabilitation hospital because of general muscle weakness 37 days after the surgery. The oral antiplatelet medication was stopped after the second surgery. Fifteen days after the transfer, he was admitted to our hospital again because of right hemiparesis. CT showed recurrent CSDH [Figure 2, right], and hence we considered applying middle meningeal artery (MMA) embolization to him. However, because his previous imaging studies revealed severe arteriosclerosis, we abandoned the procedure. Instead, we performed third irrigation and drainage through the same burr hole. The hematoma cavity was irrigated with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The right hemiparesis disappeared after the surgery. The patient was admitted to observe any recurrence of CSDH as well as for rehabilitation. Twenty-seven days after the third surgery, he suffered gait disturbance, and CT revealed recurrent CSDH [Figure 3 left]. Fourth irrigation and drainage through another burr hole on the left parietal convexity was performed. The drain was placed anteriorly to reduce postoperative air collection [Figure 3, right]. Unfortunately, the CSDH recurred with mild right hemiparesis after 9 days [Figure 4, left].CT scan on admission showing left CSDH with moderate rightward midline shift (left). CT scan obtained 1 day after first burr hole irrigation and drainage showing the hematoma is replaced with air collection (right)CT scans before the second surgery (left) and the third surgery (right)CT scans obtained before (left) and 1 day after (right) the fourth surgery. The tip of the drainage tube is placed on the frontal side and the subdural air collection is reduced compared to the finding after the first surgery (Figure 1, right)CT scans obtained before (left) and 1 day after (right) the fifth surgery. The tip of the drainage tube is placed more anteriorly with thin subdural space with minimum air collectionFifth surgery was supplemented by a simple noninvasive treatment, fibrin glue injection into the hematoma cavity through the drainage tube. Fifth irrigation and drainage through the former parietal burr hole was performed, the hematoma was removed and the cavity thoroughly irrigated, and then a drainage tube was placed anteriorly toward the frontal tip, minimizing the hematoma cavity. On the following day, CT confirmed the collapsed hematoma cavity with minimum air collection [Figure 4, right]. After obtaining informed consent, fibrin glue was injected through the drainage tube. The patient was placed in the left lateral position so that the affected side was lower. First, 12 ml of the residual hematoma was carefully evacuated through the drainage tube. Then, 5 ml of solution A of fibrin glue (Beriplast\u00ae P Combi-Set, Aventis Behring GmbH) was injected through the drainage tube and flushed with a few ml of saline, and subsequently 5 ml of solution B was injected. Finally, the drainage tube was slowly pulled away during flushing with a few ml of saline [Figure 5]. No harmful event occurred during and after the procedure. CSDH did not recur after the procedure and the patient was discharged. No further recurrence was confirmed in 6 months after the treatment [Figure 6], and the patient has been free from symptoms for over 2 years.The patient was placed in the left lateral position. Through the drainage tube, 12 ml of the residual hematoma was evacuated, and then they were injected in order of 5 ml of solution A of fibrin glue, few ml of saline, and 5 ml of solution B. Finally, the drainage tube was slowly pulled away during flushing with a few ml of salineCT scans obtained 6 months after fibrin glue injection into the hematoma cavity. No further recurrence is apparentCSDH is generally considered to be benign. The goal of the treatment is to return the patients to previous daily life regardless of age, and is successful in most patients. However, the recurrence rates are not particularly low,[371721] and the clinical course is not always benign, especially for elderly patients,[12] with greater perioperative risk in patients aged over 85 years.[2] The implications in daily neurosurgical practice are that burr hole surgery does not involve high risk, however, recurrence and reduced daily activity with comorbidity may occur in elderly patients. Therefore, repetition of the accepted procedure should be the first choice to avoid perioperative risks for elderly patients with recurrent CSDH. However, management may present difficulties after further recurrence.Various therapeutic options with burr hole surgery have been described to reduce the recurrence of CSDH, including postoperative drainage,[8] direction of the drainage tube,[15] and irrigation with artificial CSF.[119] Such procedures may avoid recurrence, however, various risk factors may result in further recurrence for elderly patients, such as atrophic brain resulting in postoperative subdural air collection,[1519] or antiplatelet or anticoagulant agents given for comorbid disease.[372122]In our case, the antiplatelet therapy was stopped after the second surgery, the hematoma cavity was irrigated with artificial CSF at the third surgery, and the drainage tube was inserted in the frontal direction to reduce postoperative subdural air collection during the fourth surgery. However, none of these interventions was effective. Therefore, some other therapeutic option was required. Possible procedures include craniotomy with removal of the outer membrane,[10] reservoir implantation,[16] shunt implantation,[13] endoscopic resection of neomembranes,[4] and embolization of the MMA.[911] However, we selected a less invasive treatment, fibrin glue injection in the hematoma cavity, because of the high age of our patient.Pathological studies of the outer membrane have suggested that the membrane proliferates with vascularization with or without inflammatory change.[14] Continuous blood accumulation with enhanced vascularity must be present in the outer membrane of refractory cases, and the blood can be supplied through the dura mater.[20] Embolization of the MMA is intended to terminate the vascular supply of the outer membrane from outside. If such a procedure is effective, hemostasis should also be possible from inside.Review of the postoperative course of our case before the fifth surgery showed that the hematoma had a smooth density gradient with no septation, and each surgical evacuation of the hematoma had been effective. These findings implied that large areas of the outer and inner membranes were exposed in the single hematoma cavity after drainage. Therefore, fibrin glue injection could be effective for hemostasis as well as to maintain collapse of the cavity. However, various tactics have been considered to accomplish maximum spread of the limited volume of fibrin glue over the large area of membrane. The subdural dead space should be minimized and deep placement of the drainage tube in the cavity should be advantageous for optimum injection of the fibrin glue. Therefore, the drainage tube was intentionally inserted deeply toward the frontal tip to reduce air collection during the fifth surgery [Figure 4, right]. The left lateral position was considered to be preferable for the injection because the hematoma cavity might be narrowed by gravity. Furthermore, measures were taken to avoid dilution of the fibrin glue in the cavity and setting of the glue in the tube during the injection. Drainage for 1 day was presumably helpful for emptying the irrigation fluid that could dilute the glue. In addition, the residual hematoma was gently removed to avoid dilution before the injection. The tube was flushed with the minimum volume of saline to avoid setting in the tube and for maximum injection.The observed effectiveness of fibrin glue injection for the prevention of further recurrence in our case may suggest the pathophysiology of the development and evolution of CSDH. Presumably, a cycle of microbleeding with changes in coagulation and fibrinolysis in the hematoma cavity occurs during proliferation of the outer membrane.[6] Fibrin glue contains fibrinogen, thrombin, coagulation factor XIII, calcium chloride, and aprotinin. Therefore, any of these factors may have been important for breaking the vicious cycle of hematoma production. For example, reduction in recurrence of CSDH by irrigation with thrombin solution has been reported.[18]After the present case, we have had no other patients suffering from refractory CSDH with the need for fibrin glue injection. We recognize the limitation of single case presentation and further study is needed to validate this technique. However, we believe that fibrin glue injection is an effective treatment option for recurrent CSDH. This therapy may depend on optimal placement of the drainage tube with adequate evacuation of hematoma, but is minimally invasive and may be suitable for refractory cases.Nil.There are no conflicts of interest.\nhttp://surgicalneurologyint.com/Fibrin-glue-injection-into-the-hematoma-cavity-for-refractory-chronic-subdural-hematoma:-A-case-report/\n",

However, there is no established intraoperative method or postoperative management in this situation. To examine the efficacy of the intraoperative method of dural repair, which consists of using the combination of a polyglycolic acid (PGA) mesh and fibrin glue, and the postoperative management of accidental dural tear or intended durotomy. Methods Seventy-five patients (34 males and 41 females; age range, 16-80 years; mean age, 57.1 years) underwent dural repair intraoperatively from December 2007 to January 2015 at our institution. We repaired dural tears using suture or nonpenetrating titanium clips, followed by reinforcement with a PGA mesh and fibrin glue intraoperatively. In all cases, epidural drains were placed in the wound, then taken off suction and maintained on gravity only. Postoperatively, patients were kept on flat bedrest until the drain was removed, and were allowed to elevate the head and ambulate as early as possible. Medical records were reviewed retrospectively. Results Only one patient with persistent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage underwent reoperation for dural repair 4 days after the initial operation. Another patient had irrigation and debridement for superficial surgical-site infection. The remaining patients had good clinical course without reoperation. Conclusions Our method of dural repair (i.e., the combination of a PGA mesh with fibrin glue) and postoperative management appear to be effective and safe in this situation. Only one patient out of 75 (1.3%) required reoperation for dural repair.\nCopyright \u00a9 2016 The Japanese Orthopaedic Association",

The aim of this study was to investigate if fibrin-glue embedded ADSCs were a beneficial adjunct to primary coaptation in a rat sciatic nerve model. Materials and methods: Fifty male Lewis rats underwent sciatic nerve transection and subsequent epineural suture repair. The treatment group received ADSCs re-suspended in fibrin glue, while the control group received fibrin glue only. After 7, 21, 35, and 63 days, analysis involved axon count, myelin sheath thickness as well as N- and G-ratios. Additionally, muscle weight quotient (operated vs. non-operated site of the same animal) was calculated and compared between treatment and control groups. For co-detection of vital ADSCs, vessel walls, and Schwann cells, immunolabeling was performed with CM-DiI, SMA, and S-100 antibodies, respectively. Results: ADSCs led to a significant increase of myelinization at day 21 (0.508 +/- 0.085 mum vs. 0.381 +/- 0.044 mum, P = 0.025) and day 35 (0.872 +/- 0.09 micro m vs. 0.495 +/- 0.078 micro m; P = 0.01) after surgery. Axon count was significantly increased at day 21 (420 +/- 119 vs. 129 +/- 63; P = 0.003) and day 63 (284 +/- 137 vs. 111 +/- 26; P = 0.046) after surgery. N- and G-ratios were significantly different compared with control indicating enhanced nerve regeneration due to ADSC treatment at each time point (P < 0.05). Muscle weight quotient was significantly higher in the treatment group compared with the control at day 21 (44.01% +/- 6.16% vs. 35.03% +/- 2.61%; P = 0.014) and day 63 (65.49% +/- 2.81% vs. 58.79% +/- 4.06%; P = 0.009) after surgery. Co-detection of immunolabeled cells showed vital ADSCs at the neuronal repair site and in close proximity to intraneuronal vessels indicating active participation of ADSCs in the process of nerve regeneration and associated angiogenesis.

    "abstract": "Axonal injuries at the interface between central and peripheral nervous system, such as ventral root avulsion (VRA), induce important degenerative processes, mostly resulting in neuronal and motor function loss. In the present work, we have compared two different fibrin sealants, one derived from human blood and another derived from animal blood and Crotalus durissus terrificus venom, as a promising treatment for this type of injury. Lewis rats were submitted to VRA (L4-L6) and had the avulsed roots reimplanted to the surface of the spinal cord, with the aid of fibrin sealant. The spinal cords were processed to evaluate neuronal survival, synaptic stability, and glial reactivity, 4 and 12 weeks after lesion. Sciatic nerves were processed to investigate Schwann cell activity by p 75 NTR expression (4 weeks after surgery) and to count myelinated axons and morphometric evaluation (12 weeks after surgery). Walking track test was used to evaluate gait recovery, up to 12 weeks. The results indicate that both fibrin sealants are similarly efficient. However, the snake-derived fibrin glue is a potentially safer alternative for being a biological and biodegradable product which does not contain human blood derivatives. Therefore, the venom glue can be a useful tool for the scientific community due to its advantages and variety of applications.\nCopyright \u00a9 2016 Mateus Vidigal de Castro et al.",

A retrospective data analysis at a tertiary care referral center on 73 patients treated endoscopically transnasally for CSF-leaks at the ENT-department Graz between 2009 and 2012 was performed. Primary closure rate between conventional fibrin glue and autologous fibrin glue were analyzed. The Vivostat system was used in 33 CSF-leak closures and in 40 cases conventional fibrin glue was used. Comparing the two methods the primary closure rate using the autologous Vivostat system was 75.8 and 85.0 % with conventional fibrin glue. The secondary closure the rates were 90.9 % with Vivostat 92.5 % with conventional fibrin glue. The Vivosat system is a useful adjunct in endoscopic CSF-leak closure. Its advantages over conventional fibrin glue are its application system for fixation of grafting material particularly in underlay techniques.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate a fibrin sealant as an adjunct to sutured dural repair to obtain intra-operative watertight closure in cranial neurosurgery. Methods. This randomized, controlled multicenter study compared a fibrin sealant (EVICEL<sup></sup>Fibrin Sealant [Human]) to sutured dural closure (Control). Subjects underwent supratentorial or posterior fossa procedures. Following primary dural repair by sutures, the closure was evaluated for intra-operative CSF leak by moderately increasing the intracranial pressure. If present, subjects were randomized to EVICEL<sup></sup>or additional sutures (2:1 ratio), stratified by surgical approach. Following treatment, subjects were successful if no CSF leaks were present during provocative challenge. Safety was assessed to 30 days post-surgery, including incidence of CSF leakage. Results. One hundred and thirty-nine subjects were randomized: 89 to EVICEL<sup></sup>and 50 to Control. Intra-operative watertight closure was achieved in 92.1% EVICEL<sup></sup>-treated subjects versus 38.0% controls; a treatment difference of 54.1% (p < 0.001). The treatment differences in the supratentorial and posterior fossa strata were 49.1% and 75.7%, respectively (p < 0.001). The incidence of adverse events was similar between treatment groups. No deaths or unexpected serious adverse drug reactions were reported. CSF leakage within 30 days post-operatively was 2.2% and 2.0% in EVICEL<sup></sup>and control groups, respectively. In addition, 2 cases of CSF rhinorrhoea were observed in the EVICEL<sup></sup>group. Although not associated with the suture line where EVICEL<sup></sup>was applied, when combined with the other CSF leaks, the observed leak rate in the EVICEL<sup></sup>group was 4.5%. Conclusions. These results indicate that EVICEL<sup></sup>is effective as an adjunct to dural sutures to provide watertight closure of the dura mater in cranial surgery.

    "abstract": "Microsurgical suturing is the gold standard of nerve coaptation. Although literature on the usefulness of fibrin glue as an alternative is becoming increasingly available, it remains contradictory. Furthermore, no data exist on how both repair methods might influence the morphological aspects (arborization; branching) of early peripheral nerve regeneration. We used the sciatic nerve transplantation model in thy-1 yellow fluorescent protein mice (YFP; n = 10). Pieces of nerve (1cm) were grafted from YFP-negative mice (n = 10) into those expressing YFP. We performed microsuture coaptations on one side and used fibrin glue for repair on the contralateral side. Seven days after grafting, the regeneration distance, the percentage of regenerating and arborizing axons, the number of branches per axon, the coaptation failure rate, the gap size at the repair site and the time needed for surgical repair were all investigated. Fibrin glue repair resulted in regenerating axons travelling further into the distal nerve. It also increased the percentage of arborizing axons. No coaptation failure was detected. Gap sizes were comparable in both groups. Fibrin glue significantly reduced surgical repair time. The increase in regeneration distance, even after the short period of time, is in line with the results of others that showed faster axonal regeneration after fibrin glue repair. The increase in arborizing axons could be another explanation for better functional and electrophysiological results after fibrin glue repair. Fibrin glue nerve coaptation seems to be a promising alternative to microsuture repair.\nCopyright \u00a9 2015, Editorial Board of Neural Regeneration Research. All rights reserved.",

    "abstract": "Objective: When employing the lateral suboccipital approach, the thin dura shrinks due to the drying effect of illumination and air exposure, and dural substitutes are often needed for closure. We developed a new technique involving dural moisturizing with fibrin glue coating that facilitates primary dural closure. Patients and Methods: We used this technique in 12 adults who underwent the lateral suboccipital approach for 5 hemifacial spasms, 3 trigeminal neuralgias, 2 cerebellopontine meningiomas, 1 vestibular schwannoma, and 1 vertebral artery aneurysm. Fibrin glue was sprayed on the outer surface before opening the dura, and additionally sprayed on the inner surface of the reflected dural flap after opening the dura. After the intradural procedures the dura was closed with the usual knotted sutures. Results: Dural closure was performed 65-340 minutes (mean: 161.9 minutes) postdurotomy. This technique resulted in primary dural closure with a sufficient area of preserved dura in all but one patient. In this patient, the dura shrank due to coagulation of the dural attachment to the meningioma for which a small autologous substitute was required. There were no procedure-related complications such as cerebrospinal fluid leakage and meningitis. Conclusions: Dural moisturizing with fibrin glue coating is simple, protects the dura from drying and shrinkage, and facilitates primary dural closure in patients undergoing the lateral suboccipital approach.",

Fibrocaps significantly reduced TTH compared with gelatin sponge; estimated hazard ratios were 3.3, 2.1, 2.3, and 3.4 for the 4 surgical indications, respectively (each p < 0.001; primary end point). Fibrocaps significantly reduced median TTH for each indication (p < 0.001) and was superior for secondary efficacy end points of restricted mean TTH (p < 0.001) and probability of hemostasis at 3 (p < 0.001) and 5 (p <= 0.002) minutes. Adverse event incidences were generally similar between treatment arms. Non-neutralizing, anti-thrombin antibodies developed in 2% of Fibrocaps-treated and 3% of gelatin sponge-treated patients.\nConclusions Fibrocaps was well tolerated and significantly reduced TTH relative to gelatin sponge alone in all 4 surgical indications. These findings demonstrate the broad utility of Fibrocaps as a hemostatic agent for mild to moderate surgical bleeding.",

Although fibrin glue injection may achieve satisfactory cavernous sinus homeostasis, the volume and rate of injection should be kept in mind to avoid a compressive lesion on traversing cranial nerves and surrounding structures, or retrograde filling of the venous tributaries.Fibrin glue injection (Baxter Healthcare Corp., Deerfield, Illinois, United States) has been used to control intraoperative cavernous sinus (CS) venous bleeding. There have been no reported complications related to this maneuver.1\n2 We present a case in which a patient developed a sensory trigeminal nerve (TN) deficit after injection of fibrin glue into the posterior CS during resection of a petrosal meningioma. We believe this deficit was due to the compression of the trigeminal ganglion (TG) similar to balloon compression procedures but persistent until the glue resolves.A 40-year-old woman with radiation-induced petrous apex meningioma underwent resection of the lesion via a posterior fossa approach. After complete resection of the lesion, the involved dura was excised to the junction of the superior petrosal sinus and the posterior wall of the CS, where venous hemorrhage ensued. This was easily controlled with injection of fibrin glue into the posterior CS. The remaining of the procedure was uneventful. Postoperatively the patient developed new-onset ipsilateral facial numbness. There was dense hypoalgesia and hypoesthesia in the trigeminal V1 and V2 distributions, and less affected, in V3. The motor trigeminal function was intact. Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated total gross resection; however, there was expansion of the CS by the fibrin glue. Repeated postoperative MRI at 3 months demonstrated resolution of the CS expansion (Fig. 1). However, the patient's sensory TN deficit persisted after the 18-month follow-up.\nPreoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrating part of the lesion with normal configuration of the cavernous sinus (left panel). Postoperative MRI demonstrating nonenhancing expansion of the cavernous sinus due to fibrin glue injection (center panel). Repeat postoperative MRI at 3 months demonstrating resolution of the expansion (right panel).Multiple intraoperative techniques have been described for cavernous sinus hemostasis that include the use of Surgicel (Ethicon Inc., Somerville, New Jersey, United States), thrombin-soaked Gelfoam (Pfizer, New York, New York, United States), FloSeal (Baxter Biosciences, Vienna, Austria), and fibrin glue. 3\n4\n5 Although each technique has varying degrees of hemostasis, specific complications associated with these maneuvers have not been documented. Fibrin glue injection into the CS has been used safely and beneficially to control venous bleeding,1\n2 but controlling the pressure and the amount may be crucial in avoiding complications. To our knowledge, this is the first case report describing a cranial nerve deficit following fibrin glue injection into the CS. The CS expansion on the postoperative MRI is attributed to the fibrin glue that produced a compressive lesion on the trigeminal ganglion with the resultant sensory deficit.This situation is analogous to percutaneous balloon compression (PBC) of the TG for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia. The development of PBC for trigeminal neuralgia originated from successful reports of surgical manipulation of the TN for trigeminal neuralgia. Shelden et al performed proximal root compression at the TG that involved applying \u201cgentle\u201d pressure to the nerve using a blunt dissector with complete resolution of symptoms and with no sensory deficit.6 This procedure was associated with a recurrence rate of \u223c 20%.3 Later, Mullan and Lichtor introduced the PBC procedure for trigeminal neuralgia.7\nSensory complaints associated with PBC have been well documented. In a large retrospective case series, 441 of 496 patients undergoing PBC had early facial numbness (89%). However, the facial numbness persisted for\u2009>\u20093 months in only 23 patients (4.6%).8 Despite its prevalent use, there has been a wide variation of the PBC parameters including the amount of pressure (459\u20132080\u2009mm Hg), duration (0.5\u201315 minutes), and volume (0.5\u20131.1 mL) of balloon compression.9 Studies have demonstrated a direct correlation between the duration of balloon compression and the development of facial numbness. Lee and Chen performed PBC in 80 patients, while keeping the other parameters stable, the duration of compression was either 60\u2009seconds or 180 seconds. At 1-year follow-up, patients with a shorter duration of compression had lower rates of facial numbness, with similar rates of efficacy.9 Brown and Pilitsis also demonstrated an association between duration of PBC compression (1.18 versus 1.06 minutes) and facial numbness in 65 PBC procedures.10 Zanusso et al performed PBC with intraoperative pressure monitoring and demonstrated an association between high PBC pressure with greater side effects but with lower recurrence rates at 1 year.11 Similarly, Brown and Pilitsis demonstrated a trend toward facial numbness with higher PBC pressures.10\nDrawing analogies from the preceding discussion regarding PBC and TN sensory deficits, the fibrin glue injection produced a compressive lesion on the TG, similar to PBC, leading to the patient's facial numbness. In this case, the duration of TG compression was sustained for days (evident by the postoperative MRI), as compared with seconds for PBC. The amount of pressure applied to the TG by the fibrin glue injection is unknown, although it was sufficient to produce the sensory deficit without a motor deficit.Although fibrin glue injection may achieve satisfactory cavernous sinus homeostasis, the volume and rate of injection should be kept in mind to avoid a compressive lesion on traversing cranial nerves and surrounding structures or retrograde filling of the venous tributaries.",

In this study, we report our preliminary results using a fully autologous fibrin sealant agent, the Vivostat<sup></sup> system, in achieving hemostasis and CSF leakage repair during cranio-cerebral procedures. Methods: From January 2012 to March 2014, 77 patients were studied prospectively and data were collected and analyzed. Autologous fibrin sealant, taken from patient's blood, was prepared with the Vivostat<sup></sup> system and applied on the resection bed or above the dura mater to achieve hemostasis and dural sealing. The surgical technique, time to bleeding control and associated complications were recorded. Results: A total of 79 neurosurgical procedures have been performed on 77 patients. In the majority of cases (98%) the same autologous fbrin glue provided rapid hemostasis and dural sealing. No patient developed allergic reactions or systemic complications in association with its application. There were no cases of cerebral hematoma, swelling, infection, or epileptic seizures after surgery whether in the immediate or in late period follow-up. Conclusions: In this preliminary study, the easy and direct application of autologous fibrin sealant agent helped in controlling cerebral bleeding and in providing prompt and efficient dural sealing with resolution of CSF leaks. Although the use of autologous fibrin glue seems to be safe, easy, and effective, further investigations are strongly recommended to quantify real advantages and potential limitations.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Delayed persistent leak of cerebrospinal fluid is a rare but possible complication following insertion of an intrathecal pain pump insertion. The patient is a 36-year-old lady with history of RSD of bilateral lower extremities who complained of headache and swelling and pain over the catheter site four months after insertion. A seroma was identified adjacent to the catheter, aspiration of the fluid revealed presence of beta transferrin in the fluid confirming a CSF leak. After conservative management and 2 epidural blood patches, application of fibrin glue was performed. Aspiration of the fluid with subsequent analysis confirmed the presence of beta transferrin in the fluid, therefore confirming that the fluid is actually CSF which is leaking through the intrathecal catheter insertion site. Occlusive dressings by application of compression dressing and bandages in the low lumbar area in attempts to seal the CSF leak, however every time the dressing was removed, the fluid started to collect again in the subcutaneous tissue. Decision was made to inject fibrin glue in the epidural space close to the catheter insertion site. Methods: The patient was brought to outpatient surgery suite and given monitored anesthesia as needed. With C-arm guidance, an 18-gauge Tuohy needle was advanced into L3-L4 intervertebral space in close proximity to the intrathecal catheter. C-arm was used for guidance of the Tuohy needle to avoid potential damage of the intrathecal catheter. The Tuohy needle entered the epidural space about 5 cm laterally to the left from the intrathecal catheter at the level of L3-L4. Injecting IV contrast revealed good epidurogram. Two milliliters of Bio Glue was injected through the needle, and the needle was withdrawn, sterile dressing was applied. Results: One week after injection patient started to report decreased swelling over well- healed catheter insertion incision and improvement of headache. There is complete resolution of CSF leak following Bio glue application. Conclusions: There is limited research on how to manage the rare but possible persistent CSF leak. The use of a fibrin glue blood patch has been found to be effective in this case.",

    "authors": "Hayashi K., Nagano J., Hattori S.",
    "has_full_text": "yes",
    "abstract": "The authors present the case of a 64-year-old woman who was referred for severe sacral pain. She reported that her pain had been longstanding, and had greatly increased after percutaneous fibrin glue placement therapy for a sacral meningeal cyst 2 months earlier at a different hospital. An MRI scan obtained immediately after fibrin glue placement at that hospital suggested that fibrin glue had migrated superiorly into the subarachnoid space from the sacral cyst to the level of L-4. On admission to the authors' institution, physical examination demonstrated no abnormal findings except for perianal hypesthesia. An MRI study obtained at admission demonstrated a cystic lesion in the peridural space from the level of S-2 to S-4. Inhomogeneous intensity was identified in this region on T2-weighted images. Because the cauda equina and nerve roots appeared to be compressed by the lesion, total cyst excision was performed. The cyst cavity was filled with fluid that resembled CSF, plus gelatinous material. Histopathological examination revealed that the cyst wall was composed of hyaline connective tissue with some calcification. No nervous tissue or ganglion cells were found in the tissue. The gelatinous material was acellular, and appeared to be degenerated fibrin glue. Sacral pain persisted to some extent after surgery. The authors presumed that migrated fibrin glue caused the development of adhesive arachnoiditis. The risk of adhesive arachnoiditis should be considered when this therapy is planned. Communication between a cyst and the subarachnoid space should be confirmed to be sufficiently narrow to prevent the migration of injected fibrin glue. \u00a9AANS, 2014.",
    "full_text": "Postoperative adhesive arachnoiditis is an inflammatory response of the spinal leptomeninges that occurs after surgery and results in scar formation in the avascular nature of the arachnoid layer. Clinical manifestations of postoperative adhesive arachnoiditis include pain, sensory deficits, motor dysfunction, reflex abnormalities, and bladder or bowel impairment. In magnetic resonance imaging scans, signs of postoperative adhesive arachnoiditis can vary; however, some indicators can assist surgeons in locating the lesion accurately and, thus, in planning effective surgical interventions. This paper reports the case of a 37-year-old man with postoperative adhesive arachnoiditis after two surgeries for Chiari I malformation. This case illustrates the progressive development of the \u201cdelta cord sign\u201d, which refers to the formation of a thick arachnoid band causing the spinal cord to adopt a triangular shape in the axial view. This phenomenon is accompanied by the sequential occurrence of syringomyelia. During intraoperative examination, we identified the presence of the delta cord sign, which had been formed by an arachnoid scar that tethered the dorsal spinal cord to the dura. This discovery enabled us to precisely pinpoint the location of the arachnoid scar and thus provided us with guidance that enabled us to avoid unnecessary exploration of unaffected structures during the procedure. Other localization signs were also reviewed.Postoperative adhesive arachnoiditis refers to an inflammatory response of the spinal leptomeninges following surgery. A previous study reported a prevalence of postoperative adhesive arachnoiditis of up to 20% in postoperative lumbar surgery patients [1]. The most common symptom of this response is pain (92.9% of cases), followed by motor deficit (35.7% of cases) and sensory deficit (28.6% of cases) [2]. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is widely used to diagnose postoperative adhesive arachnoiditis. MRI findings associated with adhesive arachnoiditis include various features at the adhesive site, such as arachnoid cysts [3,4,5,6,7,8,9], clumped nerve roots [3,4,7,10], cord tethering [3,5,9,11,12,13], arachnoid septations [3,6,7,14,15], and arachnoiditis ossificans [3]. Additionally, nonspecific findings in cases of adhesive arachnoiditis may include hydrocephalus and syringomyelia [3,13]. These findings can be categorized as localization signs or as associated signs, with localization signs indicating the location of adhesive arachnoiditis and associated signs being consequences of adhesive arachnoiditis. In cases without localization signs before surgery, a diagnosis is typically established during surgical exploration [16]. However, surgical exploration of the spine is a time-consuming and invasive procedure. Precise localization of the adhesive site before surgery can enable surgeons to avoid unnecessary surgical exploration. Therefore, identifying the localization signs of adhesive arachnoiditis is crucial. This case report presents a new localization sign of adhesive arachnoiditis that is identifiable on MRI and that was confirmed by intraoperative findings for an adult patient with postoperative adhesive arachnoiditis. Additionally, this report reviews the literature regarding adhesive arachnoiditis and categorizes imaging findings as localization or associated signs.A 29-year-old man presented with bilateral hand numbness and clumsiness. Neurological examination revealed hyperreflexia in all limbs, indicating cervical myelopathy. MRI revealed a 5 mm descent of the tonsil below the foramen magnum with syrinx formation, which led to a diagnosis of Chiari I malformation. No congenital abnormalities were noted. The patient underwent a decompressive surgery involving suboccipital craniectomy, laminectomy of C1 and C2, and duroplasty. The first operation included a 2.5-centimeter-high and approximately 3-centimeter-wide suboccipital craniectomy. Intraoperatively, the arachnoid space was dissected to confirm cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow patency. After the surgery, the patient\u2019s clumsiness subsided; however, poor wound healing and cerebral spinal fluid leakage occurred after 3 months, necessitating a revision surgery for wound repair.Over an 8-year follow-up period, the patient\u2019s MRI examinations revealed that the syrinx had initially subsided by the 3-month postoperative MRI but subsequently progressed over the next 5 years (Figure 1). In the 8th year of follow-up, the patient returned with worsening symptoms, including intermittent neck and back pain, progressive left hemiparesis, and paresthesia lasting 6 months. Initially, the patient could walk with a cane. However, his ambulation gradually deteriorated, and he required a quadricane for walking support. In addition, he experienced numbness, clumsiness, and loss of grasp strength. His modified Japanese Orthopedic Association (mJOA) scale score was 10, and his Barthel Index score was 50. Neurological examination revealed a muscle strength of 4 in the right upper and lower extremities and a muscle strength of 2 in the left upper and lower extremities. Atrophy of the intrinsic hand muscles was observed along with hyperreflexia in all four limbs. However, no Hoffman\u2019s or Babinski signs were detected, and no cranial nerve involvement was noted. Cervical myelopathy was suspected, and cervical spine MRI confirmed the progression of the syrinx, that is, confirmed that the syrinx had extended to the C4 level, with edematous changes in the spinal cord. No brain or thoracolumbar abnormalities were discovered, and no epidural mass at the craniocervical junction was observed.During a review of the patient\u2019s cervical MRI series from previous years, a notable finding was made at the C2 level; that is, a thick arachnoid band was discovered to be attached to the spinal cord and the dural sac, causing the cord to take on a triangular shape in the axial view. This characteristic change in cord shape was termed the \u201cdelta cord\u201d sign (Figure 2). Over time, progression of the syrinx from the C2 level to the C4 level was observed. After consideration of potential factors that could contribute to recurrent syringomyelia, postoperative adhesive arachnoiditis was suspected.In order to address the postoperative adhesive arachnoiditis, a third surgery was performed. This surgery involved laminoplasty of C3\u20134 and extensive duroplasty from the suboccipital region to the C4 level. During the surgery, a thick arachnoid band was discovered. This band tethered the cord at the C2 level, confirming the presence of the delta cord sign. After separation of the arachnoid band, the syrinx collapsed, and the arachnoid space was no longer obstructed (Figure 3). After 1 year of postoperative follow-up, the syrinx collapsed, and an improvement of the edematous change in the spinal cord was observed (Figure 4). In addition, the patient\u2019s functional status improved, with his mJOA score increasing from 10 to 11 and his Barthel Index score increasing from 50 to 60. Thus, he was able to walk with the assistance of a cane and perform the majority of his daily tasks, albeit with some dependency. He continued to experience residual paresthesia in his upper limbs and left lower limb.Adhesive arachnoiditis, or an arachnoid scar, is an inflammatory response of the arachnoid mater that occurs after spinal surgery, infection, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or foreign body reaction following the use of lumbar epidural injections, oil-based myelographic contrast agents, chemical irritation, or due to idiopathic causes [17,18,19]. Clinical manifestations of adhesive arachnoiditis include pain, sensory deficit, motor dysfunction, reflex abnormality, and bladder or bowel impairment [2,20]. However, the mechanism of postoperative adhesive arachnoiditis remains unclear. In one study, the inflammation process from cytokines in CSF inhibited the healing process and caused scar formation in the avascular nature of the arachnoid layer [17]. Adhesions or scarring within arachnoid channels may cause persistent syrinx or new onset symptoms without clear evidence of obstruction to CSF flow [21]. When the arachnoid scar blocked CSF flow, the pressure gradient caused syrinx formation [22]. Differences in microanatomical structures between the ventral and dorsal subarachnoid spaces were described in detail, and the dorsal site was reported to have more mesh-like arachnoid trabeculae than did the ventral site [23]. Koyanagi asserted that the dorsal subarachnoid space, which is rich in arachnoid trabeculae and veins, is prone to adhesive changes [19]. Since the 1970s, adhesive arachnoiditis has been a key focus of research on failed back surgery syndrome. Studies conducted in 1978 by Benner, Burton, Auld, and Quiles et al. used myelography to obtain evidence regarding adhesive arachnoiditis [24,25,26,27]. Subsequent research has analyzed imaging findings related to adhesive arachnoiditis. For example, Matsui et al. revealed cauda equina adhesion on MRI in their study involving a sample of patients with adhesive arachnoiditis [28]. Research indicates that T2 MRI with true fast imaging and steady-state precession or acquisition sequences can be used to identify and localize adhesive arachnoiditis through MRI [19,29]. The MRI signs associated with adhesive arachnoiditis encompass a range of features, including hydrocephalus, syringomyelia [3,7,13,14], arachnoid cysts [3,4,5,6,7,8,9], clumped nerve roots [3,4,7,10], cord tethering [3,5,9,11,12,13], arachnoid septations [3,6,7,14,15], and arachnoiditis ossificans [3]. These are categorized as localization signs, meaning that they indicate the location of adhesive arachnoiditis, or as associated signs, meaning that they represent the consequences of the condition (Table 1). In the case described in this report, the delta cord sign indicated the presence of an adhesive arachnoid scar at the C2 level, and the scar was later confirmed during surgery. The delta cord sign is unique in terms of its provision of diagnostic information from an axial view over the cord level, and it offers insights into the natural history of syrinx formation.Typically, the arachnoid space is challenging to visualize on MRI because of its woven and loose tubular texture and because it is filled with CSF [23]. However, pathological changes can cause the arachnoid to become thicker and more compact, making it visible on MRI. In the present case, the arachnoid band connecting the spinal cord to the thecal sac initially caused cord distortion, which led to the formation of a triangular shape (Figure 2 and Figure 3). This separation of CSF flow from the cranial and caudal sides resulted in CSF filling the spinal canal and in eventual syrinx formation. Localization signs are valuable for neurosurgeons in that they enable precise surgical plans to be developed and unnecessary exploration of innocent structures to be avoided. Cord tethering, which is often revealed in sagittal views on MRI, is another localization sign [3,11,12,13]. In a Chiari I malformation case with postoperative pseudomeningocele and cord distortion, Belen et al. successfully detethered the spinal cord on the basis of a localization sign and repaired the pseudomeningocele [12]. Clumped root is another reported sign of lumbar adhesive arachnoiditis [3,11]. Surgical treatment options for postoperative adhesive arachnoiditis include adhesiolysis, expansile duroplasty, and CSF diversion from the ventricle or syrinx [19,21]. However, the outcomes of such treatments have been unsatisfactory in some cases [24,25,26,27]. For example, David et al. reported eight cases of craniocervical junction arachnoiditis with syringomyelia diagnosed through MRI. All eight cases exhibited clinical improvement after adhesiolysis and duroplasty during a mean follow-up period of 27 months (ranging from 10 to 60 months). Nevertheless, three of those cases required additional shunt surgery. Hirai et al. presented a case of adhesive arachnoiditis with a large arachnoid cyst after epidural injection administered during a cesarean section. The patient received adhesiolysis and arachnoid cyst diversion, and their symptoms improved over a period of 3 years [4]. In Koyanagi et al., only 30.8% of secondary adhesive arachnoiditis cases (n = 4) and all idiopathic adhesive arachnoiditis cases (n = 6) exhibited clinical improvement after surgical treatment [19]. However, unless localization is precise, an arachnoid scar may become widespread or not be identified during exploratory surgery [21]. Killeen et al. presented a case of severe adhesive arachnoiditis that developed after obstetric spinal anesthesia. The patient in question underwent several unsuccessful exploratory laminectomies and external drainage of the syrinx [19]. In the present case, the delta cord sign served as a localization sign indicating that the arachnoid band with cord tethering was located at the C2 level. The surgical strategy involved exploration at the C2 level to release the arachnoid band by using expansile duroplasty. Additionally, the surgical approach was extended to the C4 level and to even lower levels where necessary in order to assess the length of the arachnoid band and the flow of CSF intraoperatively. By using the delta cord sign as a guide, the surgical team was able to precisely localize the arachnoid scar, which facilitated the planning of a targeted and effective surgical intervention. In addition, extending exploration to adjacent levels enabled a comprehensive assessment of the condition of the area, which ensured that the optimal treatment for the patient was implemented. This approach was employed to alleviate the symptoms associated with adhesive arachnoiditis and to improve the patient\u2019s overall clinical outcome.We reviewed the potential causes of adhesive arachnoiditis in the present case. First, the treatment involved decompression surgery with duroplasty followed by a revision surgery for CSF leakage. Posterior fossa decompressive (PFD) craniectomy, laminectomy, and duroplasty are standard surgical treatments for symptomatic Chiari I malformation [30]. However, the appropriateness of routine use of duroplasty remains a topic of debate in the medical community. Yilmaz et al. indicated that patients for whom the cerebellar tonsil is positioned below the C1 arch may benefit from duroplasty [31]. However, a review by Xu et al. of 10 studies published from 2000 to 2017 revealed that PFD craniectomy with duroplasty led to more favorable clinical outcomes than did PFD craniectomy without duroplasty (mean difference = 0.85; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.73, 0.99; p < 0.05) [32]. However, PFD craniectomy with duroplasty was also associated with a high complication rate (mean difference = 0.34; 95% CI: 0.19, 0.60; p < 0.05) [33]; the most commonly observed complications were CSF leakage and arachnoid scar formation. The arachnoid scar formation was theoretically attributed to the exposure of the subarachnoid space to blood and muscle cell debris during the surgery as well as the use of dural grafts [33]. In the present case, the cerebellar tonsil was situated below the C1 level, prompting the surgical team to perform duroplasty to ensure sufficient decompression. However, subsequent occurrence of CSF leakage and the need for revision surgery resulted in repetitive trauma and a high likelihood of debris accumulation in the subarachnoid space. Accordingly, surgeons must carefully weigh the potential benefits and risks of duroplasty in each individual case and consider the patient\u2019s specific anatomical characteristics and clinical condition. In summary, although duroplasty can improve clinical outcomes, it can also lead to an increased risk of complications such as CSF leakage and arachnoid scar formation.Second, in the present case, we used fibrin glue to cover the suture site of the dural graft and to prevent CSF leakage. Such use of fibrin glue is common practice in surgical procedures [34,35,36]; however, fibrin glue is used to mimic the final step in the coagulation pathway to form a fibrin clot [35], which can cause a hypersensitivity reaction, as was previously observed [37]. Alternatively, fibrin glue may be inadvertently squeezed into the subarachnoid space during wound closure because it is inserted between the muscular and fascial layers. Hayashi et al. reported a case of fibrin glue-induced adhesive arachnoiditis during the treatment of a sacral meningeal cyst; in that case, direct exposure to fibrin glue caused adhesion processes to occur within the subarachnoid space [38]. In the present case, exposure to fibrin glue also caused an adhesive formation process within the subarachnoid space.Third, dural graft material is a risk factor of adhesive arachnoiditis [33]. We used DuroGen (Integra, Saint Priest, France) artificial dural graft for duroplasty in the first and revision surgeries. As an allogenic substitute, dural graft material can stimulate the inflammatory process, especially when in direct contact with the subarachnoid space [39].Finally, surgery itself and blood content are also risk factors of adhesive arachnoiditis [17,18,24,25,26,27,28,40,41]. Thus, avoiding unnecessary or repetitive exploration, removing blood clots during dura closure, employing water-tight-fashion closure, and preventing fibrin glue injection into the subdural space could be effective methods for preventing adhesive arachnoiditis.The exact underlying mechanisms of adhesive arachnoiditis remain uncertain. Although multiple case series have shed light on the progression of arachnoid scar development, a well-established animal model has yet to be investigated. Over the preceding decade, attempts to establish animal models that closely resemble spinal arachnoiditis have focused primarily on pain assessment and the development of syringomyelia [42,43]. However, the complex structure of the subarachnoid space and trabeculae pose challenges to replicating all of the intricacies of this region [44]. Due to the infrequency of adhesive arachnoiditis occurring and variations in the condition among individuals, treatments for the condition vary considerably. This variability makes conducting clinical trials or establishing treatment guidelines or algorithms difficult; decisions are often made on the basis of medical professionals\u2019 experience or the results of case series or small group studies. Notably, no comprehensive review with image-based categorization for adhesive arachnoiditis has been conducted. The present study reviewed original articles related to adhesive arachnoiditis published between 2012 to 2022. A total of 10 articles were included in this review, and the articles comprised case reports and case series. The articles contained a combined total of 18 reported cases of adhesive arachnoiditis. The average age of the affected individuals was 42.8 years, with the age range spanning 27 to 66 years. The review indicated that women (12 cases) were more susceptible to adhesive arachnoiditis than were men (5 cases). In the review, the potential causes or etiologies of adhesive arachnoiditis were diverse and included the following factors: post-spinal surgery (2 cases), subarachnoid hemorrhage (3 cases), inherited genetic anomaly (6 cases), epidural anesthesia (2 cases), spinal injury (1 case), and infection (2 cases). A noteworthy finding from the review was a report by Pasoglou et al. that the largest observed series of adhesive arachnoiditis cases occurred within a family group (n = 6); however, that study did not identify any genetic abnormalities associated with adhesive arachnoiditis, and the study lacked imaging information and treatment details [6].In recent years, surgical approaches have shifted toward releasing arachnoid scars or cysts instead of diverting CSF. Of the 10 cases identified in this review of patients who underwent decompressive surgery, 7 involved adhesiolysis or cyst aspiration, 1 involved duroplasty, and 2 involved additional shunting surgery. However, in three cases, detailed surgical techniques were not provided. Notably, some cases in the reviewed articles described laminectomy alone without mentioning adhesiolysis or cyst aspiration. However, in our experience, performing laminectomy alone without releasing the arachnoid scar is not common practice.The focus of the present study was imaging examinations and their correlations with surgical outcomes. Among the patients in the reviewed articles of this study, 12 exhibited localization signs, including arachnoid cysts (n = 8), arachnoid septations (n = 3), tethered or distorted cords (n = 4), and clumped nerve roots or cauda equine (n = 4). Additionally, three patients had syringomyelia as an associated sign, with this sign often occurring in combination with other localization signs. Notably, the use of localization signs has improved surgical precision and is associated with favorable functional outcomes [21,37,38,39,40,41,42,43], except in cases of diffuse lesions or those involving other etiologies like infection or inflammation [3,39,42]. Within the surgical intervention groups of the reviewed studies (n = 13), 11 patients experienced improved (n = 5, 38.4%) or stabilized (n = 6, 46.1%) clinical or radiological outcomes, whereas 2 cases (15.3%) exhibited worsened conditions. In the conservative treatment groups of these studies (n = 3), one case (33.3%) worsened, and two cases (66.7%) remained stable. Regarding the cases with worsened outcomes, Killeen et al. reported a patient with diffuse lesions who underwent multiple surgical interventions without a satisfactory outcome [11]. Pasoglou et al. reported a case (Case 1) with poor outcomes after surgery; however, no details regarding the imaging or surgical techniques were reported [6]. Jurga et al. reported a case (Case 2) of a poor outcome after surgery; however, the study noted unknown inflammatory disease in its pathology report, and an image of adhesive arachnoiditis included in their article indicated that the adhesive arachnoiditis was not as typical as other cases of the condition are [14]. Overall, surgical treatment generally provides an opportunity to improve or maintain functional outcomes. Research findings on the topic are compiled in Table 2 [4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,14,15]. We conducted an organized review of these articles to offer guidance to physicians who encounter similar cases in the future.Postoperative adhesive arachnoiditis refers to an inflammatory response of the spinal leptomeninges following surgery. Recognizing the localization signs of adhesive arachnoiditis is crucial to effective surgery planning and to avoiding unnecessary exploration of innocent structures.In this study, we introduced the delta cord sign, a unique indicator that provides diagnostic information from an axial view over the cord level and that offers insights into the natural history of syrinx formation. Releasing the fibrotic arachnoid band by using the delta cord sign was able to restore CSF flow and led to functional recovery in the present case.Disclaimer/Publisher\u2019s Note: The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).

(A) Typical Chiari I malformation before decompressive surgery. (B) Due to transient dysphagia, we arranged a C-spine MRI 1 week after decompressive surgery. Mild edematous change over the medulla was observed, and short-term steroid administration was prescribed. Adequate decompression was achieved, and the syrinx shrunk. (C) CSF leakage was noted 3 months after the first surgery, for which dura repair was performed. MRI before the surgery revealed no signs of infection, and the syrinx length had decreased. (D) Six months after the revision surgery, MRI revealed mild progression of the syrinx and that the cord to the thecal sac was tethered. (E) In the 5th year of follow-up, the syrinx continued to progress and extended to the C3 level. Edematous change to the spinal cord was also observed. However, no clinical symptoms had developed. (F) In the 8th year of follow-up, progressive left side hemiparesis was observed, and MRI revealed syrinx extension to the C4 level, for which revision surgery was performed.Axial view of the C2 level at multiple time points. (A) Three months after the first surgery. (B) After 1 year, a thick arachnoid band (white arrow) had attached to the posterior aspect of the thecal sac, giving the cord a triangular shape, that is, the \u201cdelta cord\u201d sign. Syrinx progression was observed from that point onward. (C) The spinal cord had attached to the thecal sac, and syrinx progression and cord edematous change were observed.Surgical findings. (A) At the C2 level, a thick arachnoid band (white arrow) extended to the C4 level and obstructed CSF flow between the cranial and caudal sites. This finding was consistent with our previous MRI finding of the delta cord sign (we rotated the axial MRI view 180\u00b0 to match the surgical finding). (B) After the release of the arachnoid band (arrow heads), the cord collapsed and connected CSF flow from the cranial and caudal sites.(A) Delta cord sign and (B) 1 year after surgery.

    "abstract": "Acellular nerve grafting is often inferior as well as an inadequate alternative to autografting for the repair of long gaps in peripheral nerves. Moreover, the injection method is not perfect. During the injection of cells, the syringe can destroy the acellular nerve structure and the limited accumulation of seed cells. To resolve this problem, we constructed a nerve graft by acellular nerve grafting. Bone marrow-mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSCs) were affixed with fibrin glue and injected inside or around the graft, which was then used to repair a 15-mm nerve defect in rats. The acellular nerve graft maintained its structure and composition, and its tensile strength was decreased, as determined by two-photon microscopy and a tensile testing device. In vitro, MSCs embedded in fibrin glue survived and secreted growth factors such as nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). We repaired 15-mm Sprague-Dawley rat sciatic nerve defects using this nerve graft construction, and MSCs injected around the graft helped improve nerve regeneration and functional recovery of peripheral nerve lesions as determined by functional analysis and histology. Therefore, we conclude that supplying MSCs in fibrin glue around acellular nerves is successful in maintaining the nerve structure and can support nerve regeneration similar to the direct injection of MSCs into the acellular nerve for long nerve defects but may avoid destroying the nerve graft. The technique is simple and is another option for stem cell transplantation. \u00a9 2014 Cognizant Comm. Corp.",

    "abstract": "Background: The introduction of extended endoscopic endonasal approaches for the management of midline skull base lesions has brought again the focus on the problem of postoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak management. Notwithstanding the improvements in reconstruction techniques that have reduced the rate of postoperative CSF leakage, no technique has proven to be thoroughly effective.\nMethods: Nine patients complaining of postoperative CSF leaking after extended endoscopic endonasal surgery for different suprasellar lesions were managed without reoperation by means of repeated endoscopic endonasal fibrin glue injections in the sphenoid sinus cavity while they were awake in the outpatient operating room. Only a few patients required light sedation with benzodiazepine. To help the healing process, lumbar CSF diversion was used in four patients who complained of moderate and severe leaks, Results: We achieved an effective and resilient closure of the skull-base defect in all cases who underwent the endoscope-guided fibrin glue injection for the management of postoperative CSF leak after endoscopic endonasal surgery. Of the four patients presenting a \"weeping\" leak, one patient required a single injection, whereas three required two procedures; no lumbar drainage was used. Two patients with \"moderate\" leaks received four injections and in both a lumbar drain also was positioned. In the other two patients, three (in this case a lumbar drain was used) and two injections were performed, respectively. We managed the patient with severe leaking by performing an injection five times, and lumbar drainage was placed. No complications related to procedure or to the use of this material were observed (mean follow-up, 26.6 months; range, 5-63).\nConclusions: An endoscope-guided sealant technique with fibrin glue used while the patient is awake has proven, in our experience, to be effective in reducing the rate of reoperations in the management of postoperative CSF leaking after endoscopic endonasal approaches for the treatment of intradural skull base lesions. This technique, which needs larger case series to be validated, could be considered in the spectrum of possibilities to manage selected postoperative CSF leakages.\nCopyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Inc.",

    "abstract": "Root lesions may affect both dorsal and ventral roots. However, due to the possibility of generating further inflammation and neuropathic pain, surgical procedures do not prioritize the repair of the afferent component. The loss of such sensorial input directly disturbs the spinal circuits thus affecting the functionality of the injuried limb. The present study evaluated the motor and sensory improvement following dorsal root reimplantation with fibrin sealant (FS) plus bone marrow mononuclear cells (MC) after dorsal rhizotomy. MC were used to enhance the repair process. We also analyzed changes in the glial response and synaptic circuits within the spinal cord. Female Lewis rats (6-8 weeks old) were divided in three groups: rhizotomy (RZ group), rhizotomy repaired with FS (RZ+FS group) and rhizotomy repaired with FS and MC (RZ+FS+MC group). The behavioral tests electronic von-Frey and Walking track test were carried out. For immunohistochemistry we used markers to detect different synapse profiles as well as glial reaction. The behavioral results showed a significant decrease in sensory and motor function after lesion. The reimplantation decreased glial reaction and improved synaptic plasticity of afferent inputs. Cell therapy further enhanced the rewiring process. In addition, both reimplanted groups presented twice as much motor control compared to the non-treated group. In conclusion, the reimplantation with FS and MC is efficient and may be considered an approach to improve sensory-motor recovery following dorsal rhizotomy.\nCopyright \u00a9 2014 Benitez, Barbizan, Spejo, Ferreira, Barraviera, Goes and de Oliveira.",

    "has_full_text": "no",
    "abstract": "Background: An outstanding issue regarding the surgical treatment of cyst-type metastatic brain tumors is the incomplete resection of cyst walls. Herein we propose a novel surgical technique that can overcome this issue. During a surgical procedure for cystic tumors, autologous fibrin glue is to be injected into the tumor cysts, which solidifies the cyst lumens and cyst walls en bloc with reducing the tumor size. As a result, tumor masses and cyst walls can be removed completely in an en bloc fashion in all cases. Copyright:\nMethods: The illustrative case presented in this report is a patient with metastatic brain tumors in the frontal lobe. When we reached the tumor wall surgically, we first suctioned out the cyst content and subsequently injected autologous fibrin glue into the cyst lumen. The autologous fibrin glue solidified the tumor en bloc, and we resected the tumor mass and the cyst walls in an en bloc fashion.\nResults: We have applied this technique to four cases with cyst-type metastatic brain tumors. This approach made it possible to perform ideal en bloc resection in all cases. There were no adverse events due to the autologous fibrin glue.\nConclusion: We developed a novel surgical technique to solidify cyst-type metastatic brain tumors using autologous fibrin glue, which allows en bloc resection of tumor masses and cyst walls quite safely using inexpensive materials. Given these advantages, it appears a promising surgical strategy for cyst-type metastatic brain tumors.\nCopyright \u00a9 2014 Okuda T.",

A Simpson I resection was achieved. Postoperatively a considerable and not conservatively repairable CSF leak was detected. Surgical revision of the wound with repair of the fistula and complex reconstructive operation was performed including a combination of techniques and devices such as autologous fibrin glue and reparation of the extracranial planes by an autologous vascularized vastus lateralis pedicled muscle flap.\nResults: No postoperative complications, infections or new neurological deficits were detected, and the CSF leak definitively ceased after surgery; the aesthetic results were satisfactory.\nConclusions: Reparation of CSF fistulas that arise after meningioma surgery can require a complex reconstructive surgery of the superficial layers; when cranioplasty is not feasible or indicated, a meticulous reconstruction of the extracranial soft tissues is possible also by using vascularized autologous distal muscular tissue, with close interdisciplinary cooperation.\nCopyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Risks associated with implantation of these devices include infection, bleeding, intrathecal granuloma formation, and neurologic sequelae similar to other neuraxial procedures. Intrathecal catheter placement creates the additional risk of persistent spinal fluid leak, which can lead to postdural puncture headaches as well as seroma formation and may require subsequent surgical exploration or explantation. This retrospective case series examines 3 patients at a single institution with persistent spinal fluid leak after IDDS placement (and explantation in one case) resulting in headache and/or seroma formation that were treated with epidural fibrin glue. Three patients underwent IDDS implantation with baclofen for spasticity. In 1 patient, a cerebral spinal fluid leak developed at 1-week postoperatively. After several unsuccessful epidural blood patches and surgical exploration with a catheter revision, she was ultimately treated successfully with a fibrin glue patch. The second patient received an IDDS and did well until a seroma developed 1 year later. He was likewise treated with an epidural fibrin glue patch after 2 failed blood patches. In a third patient, a spinal fluid leak developed after explantation of an IDDS and was treated with an epidural fibrin glue patch as initial therapy. \u00a9 2013 World Institute of Pain.",

    "abstract": "Background context Regardless of study design, the approval process of biologics and biological devices cannot identify every possible safety concern. Postmarketing safety surveillance can provide information based on real-world use of medical products in heterogeneous populations and is critical for identifying potentially serious adverse events, events that are too rare to be detected during premarketing studies, late complications, and events involving individuals or uses that were not evaluated in clinical trials. Purpose To review why adverse event reporting is important and how the information is used, with emphasis on the points that are most applicable for surgeons and other spine professionals. Methods This is an overview of postmarketing safety surveillance. Results Review of adverse event reports has resulted in safety notifications, label changes, and publications regarding the safety of biologics and biological devices, such as the risk of airway compromise after the use of recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein in cervical spine fusion, the occurrence of a fatal air embolism after the use of a fibrin sealant that had been applied with a spray device, and infections after allograft transplantation of human tissues. Conclusions In light of the rapid development of new biologics, postmarketing surveillance is imperative for ensuring that these products are as safe as possible. By reporting adverse events, surgeons and other health care professionals play a key role in improving and refining our understanding of the safety of biologics. \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Inc.

    "has_full_text": "no",
    "abstract": "Background: Although fibrin sealants (FSs) and fibrin glues (FGs) are predominantly utilized to strengthen repairs of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) fistulas (deliberate/traumatic) during spinal surgery, they are also increasingly utilized to achieve hemostasis. Here, we investigated whether adding Tisseel (Baxter International Inc., Westlake Village, CA, USA), utilized to address increased bleeding during multilevel lumbar laminectomies with non-instrumented fusions, would reduce or equalize the time to drain removal and length of stay (LOS) without contributing to infections or prolonging time to fusion. Methods: Prospectively, 39 patients underwent multilevel laminectomies and 1-2 level non-instrumented (in situ) fusions to address stenosis/olisthesis; 22 who demonstrated increased intraoperative bleeding received Tisseel, while 17 without such bleeding did not. Results: The 22 receiving versus 17 not receiving Tisseel, with similar clinical parameters, underwent comparable average multilevel laminectomies (4.36 and 4.25) and 1-2 level fusions (1.4 vs. 1.29 levels). As anticipated, for those receiving Tisseel, the average intraoperative estimated blood loss (EBL), total postoperative blood loss, and total perioperative transfusion requirements [red blood cells (RBC), fresh frozen plasma (FFP), platelets] were higher. However, Tisseel had the added benefit of equalizing the time to postoperative drain removal [e.g. 3.41 days (with) vs. 3.38 days (without)] and LOS [e.g. 5.86 days (with) vs. 5.82 days (without)] without increasing the infection rates (e.g. one superficial infection per group) or average times to fusion (e.g. 5.9 vs. 5.5 months). Conclusions: Adding Tisseel for increased bleeding during multilevel laminectomies/in situ fusions contributed to hemostasis by equalizing the average times to drain removal/LOS compared to patients without increased bleeding and not requiring Tisseel.

    "abstract": "Background: Fibrin sealants (FS)/glues (FG) are primarily utilized in spinal surgery to either strengthen repairs of elective (e.g., intradural tumors/pathology) or traumatic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) fistulas. Here, additional roles/benefits of FS/FG in spine surgery are explored; these include increased hemostasis, reduction of scar, reduction of the risk of infection if impregnated with antibiotics, and its application to restrict diffusion and limit some of the major complications attributed to the controversial \"off-label\" use of bone morphogeneitc protein (rhBMP-2/INFUSE). Methods: We reviewed multiple studies, focusing not just on the utility of FS/FG in the treatment of CSF fistulas, but on its other applications. Results: FS/FG have been primarily used to supplement elective/traumatic dural closure in spinal surgery. However, FS/FG also contribute to; hemostasis, reducing intraoperative/postoperative bleeding/transfusion requirements, length of stay (LOS)/costs, reduced postoperative scar/radiculitis, and infection when impregnated with antibiotics. Nevertheless, one should seriously question whether FS/FG should be applied to prevent diffusion and limit major complications attributed to the \"off-label\" use of BMP/INFUSE (e.g., limit/prevent heterotopic ossification, dysphagia/respiratory decompensation, and new neurological deficits). Conclusions: FS/FG successfully supplement watertight dural closure following elective (e.g., intradural tumor) or traumatic CSF fistulas occurring during spinal surgery. Additional benefits include: intraoperative hemostasis with reduced postoperative drainage, reduced transfusion requirements, reduced LOS, cost, scar, and prophylaxis against infection (e.g., impregnated with antibiotics). However, one should seriously question whether FS/FG should be used to contain the diffusion of BMP/INFUSE and limit its complications when utilized \"off-label\".

We investigated fibrin glue (FG) as a drug delivery system for the local administration of high-concentration TMZ aimed at preventing glioma recurrence. Our high-power liquid chromatography studies indicated that FG containing TMZ (TMZ-FG) manifested a sustained drug release potential. We prepared a subcutaneous tumor model by injecting groups of mice with three malignant glioma cell lines and examined the antitumor effect of TMZ-FG. We estimated the tumor volume and performed immunostaining and immunoblotting using antibodies to Ki-67, cleaved caspase 3, LC3 and p16. When FG sheets containing TMZ (TMZ-FGS) were inserted beneath the tumors, their growth was significantly suppressed. In mice treated with peroral TMZ plus TMZ-FGS the tumors tended to be smaller than in mice whose tumors were treated with TMZ-FGS or peroral TMZ alone. The TMZ-FGS induced autophagy, apoptosis and senescence in subcutaneous glioma tumor cells. To assess the safety of TMZ-FG for normal brain, we placed it directly on the brain of living mice and stained tissue sections obtained in the acute and chronic phase immunohistochemically. In both phases, TMZ-FG failed to severely damage normal brain tissue. TMZ-FG may represent a safe new drug delivery system with sustained drug release potential to treat malignant glioma. \u00a9 2014 The Authors.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: We report the methods and effects of sellar reconstruction using biomaterials in 449 cases of pituitary adenoma undergoing transsphenoidal surgery from August 2009 to August 2010. METHODS: During transsphenoidal surgery (including 15 cases assisted with endoscope), diaphragma sellae damage and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage occurred in 52 cases intraoperatively. The resection cavity was packed with absorbable hemostatic cotton and gelatin sponge, and then artificial dura mater and fibrin glue were used to seal and reconstruct the sellar floor. Postoperative and delayed CSF leakage occurred in 6 and 2 cases, respectively. To manage the CSF leakage, the removal of intranasal vaseline gauze was postponed; and meanwhile, continuous lumbar CSF drainage and/or mannitol were used to decrease the intracranial pressure. RESULTS: The incidence of CSF leakage was 12% (52 cases) intraoperatively, 1.3% (6 cases) postoperatively, and incidence of delayed CSF leakage was 0.45% (2 cases). For cases of postoperative CSF leakage, postponed removal of intranasal vaseline gauze and reducing intracranial pressure were effective methods. Most cases were cured in 1 week. CONCLUSION: In transsphenoidal surgery of pituitary adenoma, an exact intrasellar packing and sellar floor reconstruction with artificial dura mater and fibrin glue are effective and affirmative to prevent postoperative CSF leakage.

There have been no reported complications related to this maneuver. We present a case where a patient developed a sensory trigeminal nerve (TN) deficit, after injection of fibrin glue into the posterior CS during resection of a petrosal meningioma. Case Report: A 40 year-old female with radiation induced petrous apex meningioma. Operation: The patient underwent resection of the lesion via a posterior fossa approach. After complete resection of the lesion, the involved dura was excised to the junction of the superior petrosal sinus and the posterior wall of the CS, where venous hemorrhage ensued. This was easily controlled with injection of fibrin glue into the posterior CS. The remaining of the procedure was uneventful. Postoperatively, the patient developed new onset ipsi-lateral facial numbness. There was dense hypoalgesia and hypoesthesia in the trigeminal V1 and V2 distribution, and less effected, in V3. The motor trigeminal function was intact. Post-op MRI demonstrated total gross resection; however, there was expansion of the CS by the fibrin glue. Repeated post-op MRI at three months, demonstrated resolution of the CS expansion (see Fig. 1). However, the patient's sensory TN deficit persisted after 18 months follow-up. Discussion: To our knowledge, this is the first case report describing a cranial nerve deficit following fibrin glue injection into the CS. The CS expansion on the post-op MRI is attributed to the fibrin glue, which produced a compressive lesion on the trigeminal ganglion (TG) with the resultant sensory deficit. This situation is analogous to percutaneous balloon compression (PBC) of the TG for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia. A known complication of PBC is TN sensory deficit, which has been shown to relate to the amount and duration of PBC pressure on to the TG. Though fibrin glue injection may achieve satisfactory cavernous sinus homeostasis, the volume and rate of injection should be kept in mind to avoid a compressive lesion on traversing cranial nerves and surrounding structures, or retrograde filling of the venous tributaries.

Repeat postoperative MRI at 3 months demonstrating resolution of the expansion (right panel).Multiple intraoperative techniques have been described for cavernous sinus hemostasis that include the use of Surgicel (Ethicon Inc., Somerville, New Jersey, United States), thrombin-soaked Gelfoam (Pfizer, New York, New York, United States), FloSeal (Baxter Biosciences, Vienna, Austria), and fibrin glue. 3\n4\n5 Although each technique has varying degrees of hemostasis, specific complications associated with these maneuvers have not been documented. Fibrin glue injection into the CS has been used safely and beneficially to control venous bleeding,1\n2 but controlling the pressure and the amount may be crucial in avoiding complications. To our knowledge, this is the first case report describing a cranial nerve deficit following fibrin glue injection into the CS. The CS expansion on the postoperative MRI is attributed to the fibrin glue that produced a compressive lesion on the trigeminal ganglion with the resultant sensory deficit.This situation is analogous to percutaneous balloon compression (PBC) of the TG for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia. The development of PBC for trigeminal neuralgia originated from successful reports of surgical manipulation of the TN for trigeminal neuralgia. Shelden et al performed proximal root compression at the TG that involved applying \u201cgentle\u201d pressure to the nerve using a blunt dissector with complete resolution of symptoms and with no sensory deficit.6 This procedure was associated with a recurrence rate of \u223c 20%.3 Later, Mullan and Lichtor introduced the PBC procedure for trigeminal neuralgia.7\nSensory complaints associated with PBC have been well documented. In a large retrospective case series, 441 of 496 patients undergoing PBC had early facial numbness (89%). However, the facial numbness persisted for\u2009>\u20093 months in only 23 patients (4.6%).8 Despite its prevalent use, there has been a wide variation of the PBC parameters including the amount of pressure (459\u20132080\u2009mm Hg), duration (0.5\u201315 minutes), and volume (0.5\u20131.1 mL) of balloon compression.9 Studies have demonstrated a direct correlation between the duration of balloon compression and the development of facial numbness. Lee and Chen performed PBC in 80 patients, while keeping the other parameters stable, the duration of compression was either 60\u2009seconds or 180 seconds. At 1-year follow-up, patients with a shorter duration of compression had lower rates of facial numbness, with similar rates of efficacy.9 Brown and Pilitsis also demonstrated an association between duration of PBC compression (1.18 versus 1.06 minutes) and facial numbness in 65 PBC procedures.10 Zanusso et al performed PBC with intraoperative pressure monitoring and demonstrated an association between high PBC pressure with greater side effects but with lower recurrence rates at 1 year.11 Similarly, Brown and Pilitsis demonstrated a trend toward facial numbness with higher PBC pressures.10\nDrawing analogies from the preceding discussion regarding PBC and TN sensory deficits, the fibrin glue injection produced a compressive lesion on the TG, similar to PBC, leading to the patient's facial numbness. In this case, the duration of TG compression was sustained for days (evident by the postoperative MRI), as compared with seconds for PBC. The amount of pressure applied to the TG by the fibrin glue injection is unknown, although it was sufficient to produce the sensory deficit without a motor deficit.Although fibrin glue injection may achieve satisfactory cavernous sinus homeostasis, the volume and rate of injection should be kept in mind to avoid a compressive lesion on traversing cranial nerves and surrounding structures or retrograde filling of the venous tributaries.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Topical hemostatic agents are important adjuncts for controlling surgical bleeding. The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a dry-powder, fibrin sealant containing human plasma-derived thrombin and fibrinogen in reducing time to hemostasis (TTH). METHODS: Multicenter, randomised control trial (RCT) (clinicaltrials. gov: NCT01527357) comparing fibrin sealant plus gelatin sponge vs. gelatin sponge alone in 4 surgical indications (spinal, hepatic, vascular, soft tissue), run in parallel as independently-powered trials for efficacy and pooled across indications for safety. Adult patients with mild/moderate surgical bleeding were randomized 2:1 to fibrin sealant or gelatin sponge during surgery. The primary efficacy endpoint was a comparison of the time to hemostasis (TTH) survival curves over 5 minutes. Subjects were followed for 28 days for safety. RESULTS: 719 patients provided informed consent, were randomized, and treated (fibrin sealant: 480; gelatin sponge: 239) while undergoing spinal (n=183), vascular (n=175), hepatic (n=180), or soft tissue (n=181) procedures. Fibrin sealant was applied by proprietary spray device in 53% of procedures and significantly reduced TTH compared to gelatin sponge, with hazard ratios of 3.3, 2.1, 2.3, and 3.4 for the 4 surgical indications, respectively (each p<0.0001). Adverse event incidences were generally similar between treatment groups and none were related to the spray device. Non-neutralizing, anti thrombin antibodies developed in 2% of fibrin sealant and 3% of gelatin sponge-treated patients. CONCLUSIONS: A ready to use, dry-powder, fibrin sealant was well tolerated and significantly reduced TTH across a wide variety of surgical procedures, strongly supporting its safety and broad utility as a hemostatic agent.",

They usually reflect severe neurological dysfunction and significant mortality has been reported in the literature. Objective: To assess initial clinical presentation, EEG features, etiology, evolution, and prognosis in patients with PLEDs. Material and Methods: A retrospective analysis of patients with an EEG pattern of PLEDs seen between 2008 and 2013 followed for 1 to 5 years was conducted. Semiology of the seizures and neuroimaging, neurometabolic, PL, and laboratory studies were evaluated. Results: Ten patients (6 male and 4 female) were included in the study. In seven, the PLEDs were unilateral and in the 3 remaining patients they were bilateral and asymmetric. Four children had herpes encephalitis, 2 immune-mediated encephalitis, 1 mitochondrial disease, 1 late-onset childhood lipofuscinosis, 1 a glioma, and the cause was unknown in 1. Four patients presented with focal-onset secondarily generalized seizures associated with an infectious etiology and chronic encephalopathy of unknown etiology and the remaining children had generalized and focal myoclonic seizures. A better response to treatment was obtained with a combination of LVT and TPM; VGB, corticosteroids, and the ketogenic diet were also used. The patients with lipofuscinosis and herpes-associated rhabdomyosarcoma developed refractory status epilepticus and died. The patients with herpes encephalitis became seizure free and their EEG pattern improved. Seizures were difficult to control in those with immune-mediated encephalitis. Conclusions: PLEDs are associated with nonconvulsive status epilepticus and infectious, metabolic, and structural etiologies. Early diagnosis allows for vigorous treatment.",

Methods: Five hippocampal specimens were obtained from surgery to treatment of drug-resistant Rasmussen Encephalitis (RE) (age range from 3 to 15 years old). All patients included in this study were adequately informed and gave their written consent for the scientific project, which was approved by the local ethics committees of the University of Erlangen (Germany) and the Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo (Brazil). All procedureswere conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (1964). Hippocampal tissue obtained from three human autopsy cases (age range from 5 to 27 years old) were used as control, whose causes of death were unrelated to reports of neurological disease. All specimenswere submitted to immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence for neuronal counting (NeuN, H&E) and the verification of neurogenesis (Ki67, vimentin and Sox2) in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. After quantification in an optic microscope, comparisons were performed by analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni's posthoc test (ANOVA-Bonferroni) and non-parametric t-test, with Mann-Withney posttest. Results: The number of neurons in the dentate gyrus was significantly decreased in RE patients when compared to control specimens. In contrast to autopsy specimens, dentate gyrus of RE patients showed an expressive increase in neurogenesis when the marker Ki-67 was used, but no significant changes could be detected with vimentin or SOX-2. Conclusions: These results suggest that Rasmussen Encephalitis is accompanied by increased neurogenic rates in the dentate gyrus when compared to specimens obtained from non-epilepsy cases. Besides, the neuronal cell loss observed in the dentate gyrus of these patientswas notaccompaniedby similar changes in other hippocampal areas. Studies aiming at investigating the relation of these changes with the severe inflammatory process observed in RE are now in progress.",

All patients completed a comprehensive standardized preoperative evaluation. For inclusion, patients should have at least one pre and post-surgical computerized visual field examination, and at least one-year follow-up. Results: For both sAHC (n=60; 11 right, 49 left) and ATL (n=60; 45 right, 15 left), association with VFD was significant (-2= 20.89, p=0.000). VFD comprised only quadrantanopsia, with higher incidence in the ATL compared to the sAHC group [73.3% vs 31.7%; U(4.55), p<0.0000]. The odds ratio for developing quadrantanopsia after ATL was 2.8 (95% CI, 1.6-4.9). At follow-up, 115 (95.8%) patients had the same visual field (57 normal, 58 quadrantanopsia), 3 (2.5%) patients had partial recovery of quadrantanopsia (1 sAHC vs 2 ATL), and 2 (1.7%) patients had total recovery of quadrantanopsia, all from ATL group. Seizure outcome was Engel class I for 104 patients, Engel class II for 13 patients, and Engel class III for 3 patients. Conclusions: In our sample, sAHC was associated with less VFD after surgery. Some of these patients may recover their visual field over time, but systematic evaluation is needed, which would be significant when assessing post-surgical quality of life.",

    "abstract": "Object. Several materials, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) hydrogel and fibrin glue, have been used to seal dural incisions after brain and spinal surgeries. Although the use of PEG sealant is gaining popularity, it can be associated with postoperative cerebrospinal fluid leakage and infection. However, the reasons for this association are currently unknown. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of PEG sealant and fibrin glue on wound healing and brain damage in vivo. Methods. Oval-shaped bone defects and dural defects were created bilaterally over the parietal lobes of 22 Japanese white rabbits. The dural defects were covered with 0.5 ml of fibrin glue on one side and 0.5 ml of PEG sealant on the other side. Dural regeneration and brain damage were investigated in each harvested brain and dura mater using light microscopy. Results. Dural regeneration was more effective in the presence of fibrin glue than it was with PEG sealant (p = 0.014). Of the 22 rabbits, 11 showed thick (Grades ++ and +++) dural regeneration by 28 days postsurgery in the hemisphere where fibrin glue was used, whereas Grade +++ dural regeneration was not observed in the PEG hydrogel hemisphere, and only 4 rabbits showed Grade ++ regeneration. Abscess and granulation formation also tended to be more severe when PEG hydrogel sealant was used. No Grade ++ granulation/abscess formation was observed with fibrin glue, and Grade + was only observed in 13 of 22 rabbits. Conversely, with PEG hydrogel sealant, only 2 rabbits did not show granulation/abscess formation, and Grade +, ++, and +++ granulation/abscess formation was observed in 8, 7, and 5 rabbits, respectively. The extent of cortical damage was significantly greater in rabbits with abscesses and granulations, compared with rabbits without these lesions (p = 0.007). Conclusions. Dural regeneration tended to occur more rapidly with fibrin glue, whereas granulation was more likely with PEG hydrogel sealant, which led to postoperative complications. Histological analysis indicated that PEG hydrogel sealant inhibited the normal tissue healing process and that outcomes were improved by the use of fibrin glue. \u00a9AANS, 2013.",

All remaining patients had successful decompressions with full resolution of their symptoms except for one patient who had persistent headaches.Autologous pericranium with dural sealant augmentation is an effective technique for expansile duraplasty in CM1 decompressions.The Chiari 1 malformation (CM1) is defined as protrusion of the cerebellar tonsils below the foramen magnum of greater than 5 mm [Figure 1a][13] with a prevalence of approximately 1 in 1,280 individuals,[42] the majority of which are asymptomatic.[446] A shallow posterior fossa (p-fossa) along with a congenitally smaller foramen magnum leads to hindbrain compression with descent of the tonsils, often causing symptoms such as tussive headaches, drop attacks, neck-, arm-, or back pain, swallowing difficulties, upper extremity dissociated sensory loss, or lower cranial nerve findings.[38]Intraoperative images outlining the technique used for decompressing a symptomatic Chiari 1 malformation. (a) Representative sagittal T2-weighted MRI of a patient with a symptomatic CM1. (b) Midline incision from one inch above the inion extending inferiorly to the mid-cervical spine. Extension of the incision above the inion allows for harvesting of the occipital pericranium using Bovie cautery. (c) Harvested pericranium kept moist in saline. (d) Suboccipital craniectomy showing initial preservation of the midline bony keel, which is later removed using Kerrison upbiters. (e) Release of dural bands exposing the cervicomedullary junction.

(i) Postoperative MRI showing full resolution of tonsillar herniation and a patent foramen magnumSurgical treatment of CM1 remains one of the most debated issues in neurosurgery today. CM1 with or without syringomyelia is managed with a suboccipital craniectomy with or without removal of at least the posterior arch of the C1-vertebra, depending on the extent of tonsillar descent[45] and option of opening the dura to increase the craniospinal CSF space. Controversy persists around the optimal amount of bony removal, necessity for dissection of subarachnoid webs, need for duraplasty and choice of employed material, augmentation of dural closure with sealants, and need for tonsillar shrinkage.[18162739] A survey by the AANS of pediatric surgeons revealed that 9% performed prophylactic surgery in asymptomatic patients, with treatment for symptomatic patients varying widely with 20% performing bony decompression alone, 30% augmenting with a dural graft, another 25% including intradural dissection of adhesions along with dural grafting, and 30% performing tonsillar resection on top of everything else.[18] Recent meta-analysis comparing decompression with or without duraplasty found that added duraplasty was associated with a lower risk of reoperation than suboccipital decompression alone but had a greater risk of CSF-related complications.[39] Specific to treatment of CM1 associated with a syrinx, Matsumoto and Symon did not notice any difference in reduction of syrinx size following duraplasty,[26] but Munshi and colleagues found that patients had greater improvement of symptoms following duraplasty.[29]Expansion of the dura with graft material following bony decompression is intended to create a capacious p-fossa to prevent recurrence of symptoms.[323643] A watertight dural repair is ideal for preventing risks of infection, aseptic meningitis, pseudomeningocele, and inflow of blood.[19] There are currently a host of autologous and foreign dural graft materials available for use. The ideal graft should not cause inflammatory reactions or adhesions, is watertight, readily available, inexpensive, and easily sterilized.[45] Synthetic materials, such as polyester mesh, silastic, Teflon or GoreTex, bovine or porcine patches, are expensive, can be difficult to shape or suture, and can cause toxic or inflammatory reactions or even hemorrhages.[35] Allogenic patches can induce immunoallergic reactions and have also been reported to be a conduit for transmittable diseases such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD), hence they are considered suboptimal.[25] The best material is one that will disappear when replaced by dura mater over time.[24]Meticulous closure of the dura is required following bony decompression for preventing CSF-related complications including meningitis, encephalitis, low-pressure headaches, arachnoiditis, and wound dehiscence.[1017344045] As true watertight dural closures are often impossible to achieve, dural sealants have been developed to be applied to the sutured dural perimeter to help prevent CSF-related complications.[14] Several dural sealants are currently available for use, including trisyline amine solution and polyethylene glycol hydrogels (Dura SealTM, Covidien LLC, Mansfield, MA, USA) and fibrin sealant (TISSEEL, Baxter, Deerfield, IL, USA). Adjuvant use of such sealants may be prudent particularly in p-fossa surgeries as the incidence of CSF leaks has been quoted to be as high as approximately 15%-28% with such surgeries,[23] with an increased odds ratio of 5.84 when compared to supratentorial procedures.[37] Given these potentially higher complication rates, we believe that diligent adjuvant use of a dural sealant along with autologous materials such as pericranium should decrease the rates of CSF-related or graft-related complications in CM1 decompression. We herein report our results with this technique.An institutional review board approved retrospective analysis was performed of clinical, and radiographic data collected in adult cases of symptomatic CM1. All patients underwent a standardized bilateral subcoccipital decompression including at least a C1 laminectomy and a dural repair using locally harvested autologous pericranium augmented with dural sealant.Patients are positioned prone on the operative table with their head secured in Mayfield pins. Following clipping of the posterior hairline using an electric razor, a midline incision is fashioned one inch above the inion extending inferiorly to the level of the mid cervical spine [Figure 1b]. By extending the incision superiorly, we are able to perform blunt dissection of the subgaleal connective tissue to harvest adequate amounts of pericranium for dural grafting, as recently described by Stevens and colleagues.[41] The graft is kept moist separately in Bacitracin enriched sterile saline until time for duraplasty [Figure 1c]. A suboccipital craniectomy is then performed using an Anspach highspeed side cutting drill bit by first removing occipital bone on either side of the midline keel, and then removing that keel using the drill as well as Kerrison rongeurs [Figure 1d]. The posterior C1 arch is removed in all cases (and possibly more inferior levels too) depending on the degree of tonsillar decent. Adequate bony removal exposes the p-fossa dura overlying the cerebellar hemispheres and the cervicomedullary junction. Dural bands constricting the craniocervical junction are released [Figure 1e] and the dura is then opened sharply in a Y-shaped fashion exposing the inferior aspect of the cerebellar hemispheres and the dorsal surface of the hindbrain [Figure 1f]. The arachnoid layer is opened and may be dissected in cases of arachnoid webs, but we do not routinely resect the cerebellar tonsils. Expansile duraplasty is then performed using the harvested pericranium [Figure 1g]. An induced Valsalva maneuver is then performed to ensure a watertight closure and a thin layer of dural sealant is then applied over the suture line and also the entire graft [Figure 1h], which is furthermore covered with a piece of Surgicel followed by another layer of dural sealant and finally GelFoam. A second induced Valsalva maneuver is then performed to document a watertight closure. The surgical wound is then closed in multiple layers beginning with muscle, ligamentum nuchae, subcutaneous tissue, and then, skin.Patients were discharged from hospital and were seen in our clinic at 10-14 days, 3 months, and at 1 year following surgery for evidence of surgical site infection or meningitis, CSF leak, pseudomeningocele, and radiographic improvement of hindbrain compression as detected with a MRI scan [Figure 1i]. A questionnaire survey was filled out during interviewing of patients and recorded \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d as well as quantified responses to the presence of the following symptoms prior to and at three months following, surgical decompression: tussive headaches, vertigo, visual disturbance, tinnitus, drop attacks, neck pain, gait and balance disturbances, dysmetria, bladder or bowel symptoms, dysphagia, and sensory deficits in the extremities.Twenty-two CM1 patients were identified. Twenty-one had tussive headaches, five had vertigo, three had visual changes, four had neck pain, three had gait disturbances, and four had dissociated sensory deficits, prior to surgery [Table 1]. At 3 months and at final follow-up, all patients had full resolution of their clinical symptoms except one patient, who had persistent headaches. This particular patient had a long history of frequent tussive headaches presenting as the only symptom of her CM1.Patient demographics and summary of postoperative complicationsOne patient presented with a delayed CSF leak at 8 weeks due to a dehiscence of the dural graft requiring surgical revision and also subsequently developed aseptic meningitis and CSF pleocytosis due to an allergy to NSAID medications. None of the other patients had any CSF-related complications or surgical morbidities at the time of follow-up.Symptomatic progression of CM1 is secondary to crowding of the cerebellar tonsils as they sit in a shallow p-fossa and smaller than normal foramen magnum.[30] A suboccipital craniectomy releases compression at the cervicomedullary junction and aims to restore normal CSF dynamics between the spinal and cortical subarachnoid spaces, indirectly treating CM1 that is associated with syringomyelia.[1539] Whether dural expansion is required in CM1 decompression has remained a debatable topic. Studies have shown improvements in brain stem auditory evoked potentials after bony decompression alone with little additional gains associated with duraplasty.[649] Matsumoto and Symon showed no difference in reduction of the size of the syrinx following duraplasty,[26] but Munshi and colleagues demonstrated that patients had improvement in their symptoms following duraplasty.[29] A meta-analysis of five retrospective and two prospective cohort studies totaling 582 patients demonstrated a significantly lower reoperation rate but higher rates of CSF-related complications in patients who received a duraplasty. Patients without duraplasty did not have significant improvements in their clinical exam or syringomyelia.[16] Given existing evidence that supports the rationale of enlarging the craniospinal CSF spaces, we regularly include an expansile duraplasty in all of our CM1 surgeries [Figure 1f].[72831] A recent study using a cerebellar tonsillar descent grading scale to determine when duraplasty is required during CM1 surgery found that duraplasty improves functional outcomes in patients with grade 3 tonsillar descent (descent below the C1 arch), while a suboccipital craniectomy alone may be adequate in grades 1 and 2 descent (descent not extending below the C1 arch).[48] All of our study patients had an improvement in their neurological function follow expansile duraplasty, supporting the need for a generous enlargement of the p-fossa in selected patients.We believe that, when available, autologous grafts should be used to prevent known adverse reactions to nonautologous materials including graft dissolution, encapsulation, immunoallergic reactions, and adhesions.[9] In particular, autologous pericranium can be locally harvested using the same incision, is nonimmunogenic, inexpensive, and effective at creating a watertight closure, especially when combined with available modern dural sealants. This is in contrast to fascia lata grafts which require a second incision,[2233] ligamentum nuchae which may compromise fascial closure,[19] or posterior atlantooccipital membrane grafts which have an increased risk of vertebral artery injury during harvesting.[44] A survey of pediatric neurosurgeons by the AANS showed that most of the surgeons preferred to use autologous pericranium (32%).[18] Vanaclocha and Saiz-Sapena compared freeze-dried cadaveric dura with fibrin sealant augmentation to autologous occipital pericranium alone and reported two CSF leaks and five pseudomeningoceles in the cadaveric dura group, while no complications were reported using autologous pericranium.[45] We did not have any CSF-related complications in our study, thus further supporting the reported benefits of autologous pericranium when used in combination with fibrin- or hydrogel-based sealants. We have also expanded and validated our technique in a case series of 100 p-fossa surgeries in which none of the patients, other than the one Chiari patient reported in this study, required revision of their dural closure.[20] However, a recent literature review did not find any superiority when comparing autologous to nonautologous grafts, which we feel is most likely due to the heterogeneity amongst studies.[1] The authors of that study also state that their institutional experience dictates that autologous pericranium should be utilized when available and of good quality.[1]A watertight dural closure is often difficult to achieve when using dural grafts because of holes produced by surgical needles.[2] Resultant CSF leaks and its associated complications, including low-pressure headaches and pseudomeningoceles, have led to the development of several types of dural sealants to reduce the risks of such complications. In particular, the incidence of CSF leak has been reported to be as high as 28% in p-fossa procedures due to its location being at the dependent portion of the skull base.[23] To date, two prospective studies have been published using dural sealant alone or in combination with autologous duraplasty materials in cranial surgeries.[314] The DuraSeal Pivotal Trial reported an infection rate of 8.1%, deep surgical infection rate of 7.2%, and 4.5% incidence of CSF leak.[3] The second trial by Cosgrove and colleagues used a polyethylene glycol (PEG) hydrogel sealant and did not report any adverse events after three months of follow-up.[14] Similarly, Boogaarts et al. prospectively treated 46 patients with a dural sealant in combination with different autologous dural substitutes and reported one overt CSF leak and one pseudomeningocele.[12] There were no CSF leaks, pseudomeningoceles, or wound infections in our patients at any point during the follow-up period, further lending support for the use of a dural sealant in combination with autologous pericranium for dural closure. This is in sharp contrast to increased rates of CSF leak, pseudomeningocele formation, and infections when nonautologous materials are used in combination with a dural sealant.[21] A recent study compared retrospective data of patients who underwent cranial operations using nonautologous materials augmented with PEG hydrogel sealant for dural closure to patients from the Pivotal Trial who received autologous materials and found that there were no significant differences in the rates of CSF leaks, but that Pivotal Trial patients had a higher rate of meningitis.[47] As this study included all patients who received craniotomies not specific to the p-fossa location alone, it is difficult to say whether the difference may be more apparent if a subgroup analysis had been performed. Of caution, there has been one case report in the literature of mass effect requiring reoperation due to in vivo postoperative swelling of the hydrogel sealant, highlighting the need for appropriate thickness of less than two millimeters when applying the sealant.[11]We attempted to further quantify the outcomes of our surgical technique in suitable CM1 patients using a questionnaire survey asking for the absence or presence of tussive headaches, vertigo, visual disturbance, tinnitus, drop attacks, neck pain, gait and balance disturbances, dysmetria, bladder or bowel symptoms, dysphagia, and sensory deficits in the extremities, before and after the decompression. Our survey is similar to the Chicago Chiari Outcome Scale (CCOS) published recently by Aliaga and colleagues in which they used four categories: pain-related symptoms (tussive headaches, neck. and shoulder pain, dyesthesias in the upper extremities), nonpain-related symptoms (dysphagia, ataxia, vertigo, muscle weakness, sensory loss, tinnitus, paresthesias, and drop attacks), functionality, and surgical complications to assess their Chiari outcomes.[5] They stratified 141 patients into two categories of either improved or unchanged outcomes. In the category of patients with improved outcomes (n = 101), approximately 45% of their patients had full resolution of their pain-related and nonpain-related symptoms, while approximately 65% had no complications and 30% had complications which resolved after a single lumbar puncture and lowering of CSF pressure. We did not include complications as part of our survey and kept it under a separate category of analysis. Our results differ to their study in that 90% of our patients (19 of 21 patients presenting with pain-related symptoms) had full resolution of their pain-related symptoms, and 95% of patients had no complications following the decompression (21 of 22 patients). The patients in their study also used autologous pericranium as a dural graft, but there is no mention of augmentation with a dural sealant, and they also included children in their study (mean age of diagnosis 20 \u00b1 16.7 years, range 1-55 years), who are more prone to CSF-related complications following surgery. These factors may have contributed to their lower rates of resolution of symptoms and higher rates of complications compared to our study, further suggesting that augmentation with dural sealant enhances surgical results. Limitations of our study include a relatively small pool of patients with the lack of a control arm due to an absence of a gold standard protocol and a relatively short period of follow-up.In summary, locally harvested autologous pericranium with dural sealant augmentation is a safe and effective surgical technique for CM1 decompression. Further validation with a larger patient pool, inclusion of a comparison arm, and longer follow-up period are required to establish superiority compared to other techniques.Available FREE in open access from: http://www.surgicalneurologyint.com/text.asp?2013/4/1/1/106114",

    "abstract": "Background:Ventral root avulsion is an experimental model of proximal axonal injury at the central/peripheral nervous system interface that results in paralysis and poor clinical outcome after restorative surgery. Root reimplantation may decrease neuronal degeneration in such cases. We describe the use of a snake venom-derived fibrin sealant during surgical reconnection of avulsed roots at the spinal cord surface. The present work investigates the effects of this fibrin sealant on functional recovery, neuronal survival, synaptic plasticity, and glial reaction in the spinal motoneuron microenvironment after ventral root reimplantation.Methodology/Principal Findings:Female Lewis rats (7 weeks old) were subjected to VRA and root replantation. The animals were divided into two groups: 1) avulsion only and 2) replanted roots with fibrin sealant derived from snake venom. Post-surgical motor performance was evaluated using the CatWalk system twice a week for 12 weeks. The rats were sacrificed 12 weeks after surgery, and their lumbar intumescences were processed for motoneuron counting and immunohistochemistry (GFAP, Iba-1 and synaptophysin antisera). Array based qRT-PCR was used to evaluate gene regulation of several neurotrophic factors and receptors as well as inflammatory related molecules. The results indicated that the root reimplantation with fibrin sealant enhanced motor recovery, preserved the synaptic covering of the motoneurons and improved neuronal survival. The replanted group did not show significant changes in microglial response compared to VRA-only. However, the astroglial reaction was significantly reduced in this group.Conclusions/Significance:In conclusion, the present data suggest that the repair of avulsed roots with snake venom fibrin glue at the exact point of detachment results in neuroprotection and preservation of the synaptic network at the microenvironment of the lesioned motoneurons. Also such procedure reduced the astroglial reaction and increased mRNA levels to neurotrophins and anti-inflammatory cytokines that may in turn, contribute to improving recovery of motor function. \u00a9 2013 Barbizan et al.",

    "abstract": "Objectives/Hypothesis Repair of the transected facial nerve has traditionally been accomplished with microsurgical neurorrhaphy; however, fibrin adhesive coaptation (FAC) of peripheral nerves has become increasingly popular over the past decade. We compared functional recovery following suture neurorrhaphy to FAC in a rodent facial nerve model. Study Design Prospective, randomized animal study. Methods Sixteen rats underwent transection and repair of the facial nerve proximal to the pes anserinus. Eight animals underwent epineurial suture (ES) neurorrhaphy, and eight underwent repair with fibrin adhesive (FA). Surgical times were documented for all procedures. Whisking function was analyzed on a weekly basis for both groups across 15 weeks of recovery. Results Rats experienced whisking recovery consistent in time course and degree with prior studies of rodent facial nerve transection and repair. There were no significant differences in whisking amplitude, velocity, or acceleration between suture and FA groups. However, the neurorrhaphy time with FA was 70% shorter than for ES (P < 0.05). Conclusion Although we found no difference in whisking recovery between suture and FA repair of the main trunk of the rat facial nerve, the significantly shorter operative time for FA repair makes this technique an attractive option. The relative advantages of both techniques are discussed. Level of Evidence N/A Copyright \u00a9 2012 The American Laryngological, Rhinological, and Otological Society, Inc.",

Reinforcement of intracranial aneurysms (IAs) by wrapping or coating is a well-established therapeutic approach to those IAs not amenable to any other definitive treatment, but has been associated with complications such as parent artery narrowing, granuloma formation, and ischemic stroke. The goal of this study was to systematically investigate cerebrovascular complications following this procedure. Methods. The authors' hospital database was searched for all patients who underwent wrapping or coating of IAs with cotton gauze and human fibrin adhesives between October 2006 and October 2011. The follow-up records of these patients were extracted, including regular clinical visits and vascular imaging. Results. Five hundred sixty-seven patients were treated for IAs over the 5-year period: 303 patients underwent endovascular strategies and 264 underwent craniotomies. Wrapping or coating of IAs was performed in 20 patients (3.5%). Parent artery narrowing occurred in 5 (25%) of the 20 patients and was associated with major ischemic strokes in 4 patients and severe headache in another. Ischemic strokes were associated with parent artery narrowing, which occurred early postoperatively in 2 patients or was a consequence of granuloma formation in 2 patients 1 and 2 months after the procedure, respectively. Conclusions. These data should add to the awareness of significant cerebrovascular complications following wrapping or coating of IAs with cotton gauze and human fibrin adhesives and indicate that major ischemic strokes need to be included in the risk/benefit considerations during decision making for such treatment strategies. Patients who receive IA wrapping should be monitored and followed up closely for arterial narrowing and granuloma formation. \u00a9 AANS, 2013.",

    "abstract": "A method to enhance the withstanding pressure of fibrin sealant in gasket-seal closure to prevent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage after extended transsphenoidal surgery (ETSS) was investigated by adjusting the mixing ratio of the components. A plastic chamber (200 ml) was constructed with a lid made of hydroxyapatite with a hole 10 mm in diameter. The chamber could be pressurized via an opening in the side wall. The hole in the hydroxyapatite lid was covered with a Gore-Tex sheet, 15 mm in diameter. The margin of the sheet was free. Solutions A (fibrinogen 80 mg/ml) and B (thrombin 250 units/ml) of fibrin sealant were mixed in volume ratios of 1:1, 2:1, and 5:1, and applied to the Gore-Tex sheet, then water was introduced to cover the fibrin sealant. The pressure was measured at which air leakage occurred from the side of the Gore-Tex sheet. The pressure values for A/B ratios of 1:1, 2:1, and 5:1 were 117 +/- 23.8 mmH<inf>2</inf> (mean +/- standard error) (n = 5), 234 +/- 38.8 mmH<inf>2</inf>O (n = 5), and 345 +/- 36.4 mmH<inf>2</inf> (n = 5), respectively, in the acute phase (5 minutes after application of fibrin sealant). Pressures were increased after 24 hours, and that for 5:1 was the highest (373 +/- 40.4 mmH<inf>2</inf>, n = 5). The use of devices such as syringes specially designed to mix solutions A and B in the ratio of 5:1 can easily enhance the preventive effect of fibrin sealant against CSF leakage in ETSS.",

    "abstract": "Purpose The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of classical suture and sutureless repair with fibrin glue, by using or not a resorbable collagen tube, after sciatic nerve transection. Material and methods Twenty-five mice were used in this study, divided in five groups. They were submitted to sciatic nerve transection and immediate repair of the nerve stumps by either direct suture or fibrin glue adhesion or by the tubulization technique in which the nerves stumps were sutured or glued to a collagen tube (experimental groups). A control group was designed as the best regeneration condition, by using a crush lesion (control group). After eight weeks, the regenerated nerves were processed for light and electron microscopy. Motor function analysis was performed using the sciatic functional index. Results Quantitative analysis of regenerated nerves between experimental groups showed that those repaired by direct contact of the stumps with fibrin glue showed significant increase in the myelin and fiber areas. The tubulization groups, repaired by suture or fibrin glue, provided similar results. G-ratio analysis revealed that the regenerating axons of all experimental groups presented values equivalent to control (crushing group). Conclusions These results suggest that the use of fibrin glue in nerve repair by either direct coaptation or tubulization is an alternative to conventional suture repair, particularly in case of small-size-nerve reconstruction. \u00a9 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This approach is considered the simplest route to the cerebellopontine angle and lateral clivus. This route may be used in a variety of surgeries, such as tumor removal, vestibular neurectomy, brainstem auditory implantation and neurovascular decompression. A variety of techniques have been successfully employed to reconstruct craniectomy and/or craniotomy bone gaps such as bone grafts, silastic, acrylic or metal plates, hydroxyapatite cement or ceramic implants.Cranioplasty using a mixture of autologous bone chips and human allogenic fibrin glue is a well known technique first reported in 1997 by Sawamura et al. We report a case of a patient using this technique in 2008 with a surprising intraoperative and histological result concerning the morphology while performing a second operation in the same patient in 2012.A 53-year-old woman underwent left lateral suboccipital retrosigmoidal craniectomy for treatment of trigeminal neuralgia in 2008. After water tight suture of the dura mater, crushed bone fragments were sprayed with a fibrinogen and thrombin mixture according to the pharmaceutical and technical instructions of this device (Tissucol Duo 1\u00a0ml Immuno-Solution\u00ae, Baxter, Germany). Then the admixture was placed on the dura mater and shaped to fit in the bone defect followed by replacing the muscle flap. Further postoperative course was uneventful. Postoperative computed tomography (CT) scan one day after surgery revealed correct placement of the mass of bone chips sealed in fibrin glue [Figures\u00a0\n1 and\n2].Axial bone-window computed tomography scan performed one day after first operation. The mass of bone chips and fibrin glue can be well identified.Three-dimensional computed tomography scan one day after first operation. Bone chips sealed in fibrin glue in the left retromastoid occipital bone.Due to recurrent neuralgia, a second left lateral suboccipital craniectomy was performed in 2012. The preoperative axial-bone-window CT scan revealed that the bone was in the top level [Figure\u00a0\n3]. Three-dimensional CT also demonstrated a complete smooth bone plate (Figure\u00a0\n4).Preoperative bone-window computed tomography scan 4\u00a0years after first operation demonstrates nearly complete ossification.Three-dimensional computed tomography scan 4\u00a0years after first operation also demonstrates a complete smooth bone plate.The intraoperative findings revealed a complete ossification of the former craniotomy. There was no clear border between the original bone and the cranioplasty. After performing the new far lateral suboccipital retrosigmoidal approach via a new burr hole, the cranioplasty was preserved for further histological examination (Figure\u00a0\n5), which confirmed a widely mature trabecular bone tissue with several circumscribed areas of osteoid (incompletely mineralized tissue) (Figure\u00a0\n6). Afterwards, the new cranioplasty was performed according to the technical steps in the first operation.Cranioplasty after performing a new far lateral suboccipital retrosigmoidal approach.Trabecular bone tissue, predominantly mature, with only small areas of incomplete mineralization (osteoid).In contrast to Sawamura et al.[1], we could investigate intraoperatively the primarily performed cranioplasty due to a recurrent neuralgia of this patient. Thus further histological examinations were possible.The physiology of osteoregeneration mediated by fibrin is unknown. Fibrin glue itself has no osteo-inductive power\n[2]. Neither biochemical nor histological parameters revealed a direct influence of fibrin sealant on any osteoinductive process\n[3].Using biphasic calcium phosphate as an osteoconductive scaffold in combination with fibrin glue is already well described as an alternative to autogenous bone graft or methyl methacrylate for posttraumatic calvarium bone defect reconstruction\n[4].As a cell-delivery vehicle, fibrin glues seems to facilitate cell attachment, growth and differentiation and, ultimately, tissue formation and organization by its three-dimensional structure\n[5].The present case demonstrates that a stand-alone implantation of a fibrinogen and thrombin mixture seems to provide sufficient bone-regeneration revealed by histological and neuroradiological examinations.It provides an easy way of sufficient rebuilding of new bone after performing a craniectomy in the posterior fossa. Further studies should reveal whether this technique is useful after craniectomy in case of other indications, e.g. tumor resections with following radio-chemotherapy.The well described capacity of cell attachment because of its structure may indicate further studies to mix stem cells or growth factors with fibrinogen and thrombin glue to research the ability of building new sufficient bone.Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying images.

    "abstract": "Introduction: Historically, direct application of morphine to the spinal cord producing spinally mediated analgesia first appeared in the mid-1970s.1 The utilization of intrathecal drug delivery systems (IDDS) provides continuous drug delivery in close proximity to the spinal cord. Intrathecal drug delivery systems (IDDS) are used to deliver opioids and adjuvants for intractable pain as well as baclofen for spasticity and rigidity in patients with spinal cord injuries.2 IDDS vary from simple percutaneous catheters to totally implantable and programmable infusion pumps. Implanted systems have gained in popularity for long-term infusions, both in cancer pain states with long survival times and in nonmalignant pain states.3 These systems provide for a broad range of delivery rates and modes, and hence flexibility. As with any surgical procedure and intervention, IDDS have several risks which include: bleeding, infection, seroma formation, equipment malfunction, neurologic damage, and persistent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage.4 Infection is usually localized; however, epidural or intrathecal sepsis is disastrous and requires the removal of all hardware and administration of systemic antibiotics.4 A case of delayed persistent CSF leakage following intrathecal pump implantation, seroma formation, and subsequent drainage is presented here. Case study: A sixty two year old male presented with progressive upper and more pronounced lower extremity tremors secondary to an unknown etiology. He underwent an intrathecal baclofen test dose with significant improvement in his lower extremity spasticity. Two weeks following the test dose, an intrathecal pump with baclofen was placed without complication and his symptoms improved greatly. One year after intrathecal pump implantation, the patient noted swelling and pain over the catheter site as well as a new-onset positional headache. The patient was evaluated and underwent magnetic resonance imaging. A seroma was identified adjacent to the catheter at the right lumbar region. Two weeks later, an ultrasound-guided aspiration of the lumbar seroma was performed showing clear, slightly yellow-tinged fluid that was confirmed to be CSF. The patient underwent an epidural blood patch and this improved his symptoms for several days after which time his symptoms returned. Two weeks later, he underwent fluoroscopically-guided L2-3 interlaminar epidural fibrin glue blood patch. Ten milliliters of fibrin glue additive in combination with two milliliters of autologous blood (total volume of twelve milliliters) was administered to the point that the patient had a mild pressure paresthesia. The patient has had complete resolution of the CSF leak following the procedure. Discussion: While IDDS has been shown to greatly improve the quality of life for many patients suffering from spasticity or severe pain, it comes with inherent risks. There is a paucity of literature showing the use of a fibrin glue blood patch as definitive treatment for persistent CSF leak.",

Previous studies showed that the treatment with TMZ induced autophagy, apoptosis and senescence in cancer cells. In this study, we focused on fibrin glue as drug delivery system (DDS) for administering a high concentration of TMZ in glioma cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used 3 malignant glioma cell lines (U87MG, two established cell lines). These cell suspensions were injected into the back of nude mice to make the subcutaneous tumor. After a few days, the various condition fibrin glue sheets were placed in contact with subcutaneous tumor (4groups, n = 6/group). We measured the tumor size in the certain period and performed immunohistochemical staining to evaluate the effect of fibrin glue mixedTMZ(F.G-TMZ) against the subcutaneous tumor. Further, the purpose of investigating the effect on the normal brain, we placed F.G-TMZ on the surface of mice brain. After 48hours and 2weeks, brains were removed and the slices were immunohistochemically stained (H.E, GFAP, COX2, etc.) to evaluate the effect of fibrin glue mixed TMZ against normal brain. RESULTS: The observation periods of sucutaneous tumor were 26-28days. All mice didn't die and no significant adverse effects were observed during the period. In all cell lines, F.G-TMZsignificantly suppressed the growth of subcutaneous tumor size than the other conditions. Immunohistochemical study showed that F.G-TMZ induced autophagy, apoptosis, senescence to the subcutaneous tumor. Further, severe inflammation, edema and demyelination caused by F.G-TMZ didn't occur in the normal mice brain at acute phase and chronic phase. CONCLUSIONS: F.G-TMZ would be a new tool of drug delivery system against malignant brain tumor.",

    "authors": "Sasaki T.",
    "has_full_text": "no",
    "abstract": "Introduction: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage is a common complication after intradural spinal surgery. Becausepersistent CSF leakage puts patients under significant risk of poor wound healing, meningitis and arachnoiditis, meticulous wound closure is important. Spinal surgery has a higher incidence of CSF leakage because of the high intradural hydrostatic pressure. Numerous methods have been developed to prevent CSF leakage after spinal surgery including use of fibrin glue, polyglycolic acid mesh and vicryl mesh. Our experience to prevent CSF leakage with 375 patients who underwent intradural spinal surgery is reported here. There was significant advantage in the incidence of CSF leaks comparing previous reports. Methods: Three hundred and seventy-five patients underwent intradural spinal surgery between 2001 and 2012 in Tokyo Woman's Medical University. One hundred and ten patients underwent selective dorsal rhizotomy, 99 underwent selective peripheral denervation, 89 underwent removal of intradural spinal tumor, 55 underwent Microsurgical DREZotomy, 5 were treated for tethered cord syndrome, 15 for arteriovenous fisturas and two were treated for adhesive arachnoiditis. Dural closure was performed by 4-0 nonabsorbable continuous suture. We performed 4 or 5 layers closure and we sew each layer on underneath structure. Meticulous closure is important at both ends of the incision. Each stitch was left until we finish closing the layer to confirm the gap of suture. We didn't use fibrin glue or polyglycolic acid mesh. Results: No symptomatic CSF leakage and no infection were marked in any case. Several cases showed postoperative pseudomeningocele but all cases have no symptoms. Conclusions: There was no CSF leakage in our series of 375 intradural spinal surgery. Watertight dural closure is not essential if muscles and subcutaneous tissues are closed meticulously. Fibrin glue is not indispensable to prevent CSF leakage. Extradural CSF collection does not cause of persistent complications.",

    "abstract": "Background and objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate both functionally and histologically the validity of the cyanoacrylate and fibrin glue for nerve anastomosing in rat sciatic nerve. Methods: In this study 45 healthy albino rats were used. In all rats, a unilateral right side sciatic nerve transection was performed and reanastomosed by different methods, the rats were classified into three equal groups: group I (control group): included 15 rats, the anastomosis was done by epineural microsutures using 10/0 nylon. Group II: included 15 rats, the anastomosis was done by using nbutyl- 2-cyanoacrylate (Histoacryl). Group III: included 15 rats, the anastomosis was done by using fibrin glue. Evaluation of recovery was done both functionally and histologically. Results: Functional results showed that there was significant difference of the sciatic functional index (SFI) between group I and group II and between group II and group III while there was no significant difference of SFI between group I and group III at the different follow up periods. Histological results showed that after three months there was no complete axonal regeneration in the three groups. The axonal regeneration in group II was less than that in group I and group III. Group II showed foreign body inflammatory reaction and increasing degree of fibrosis. The axonal regeneration was more better in group III when compared with group I which showed mild degree of fibrosis. Conclusions:We can conclude that Fibrin glue was better than the n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate both functionally and histologically and could be used as an alternative technique to epineural suturing in the microsurgical repair of the transected nerves.",

In addition to the foreign body reaction to the suture material, the surgical duration and difficulty of suturing in confined anatomic locations are major problems. We evaluated the effectiveness of fibrin glue as an acceptable alternative for nerve anastomosis in dogs. Methods: Eight adult female dogs weighing 18 to 24 kg were used in the present study. The facial nerve was transected bilaterally. On the right side, the facial nerve was subjected to epineural suturing; and on the left side, the nerve was anastomosed using fibrin adhesive. After 16 weeks, the nerve conduction velocity and proportion of the nerve fibers that crossed the anastomosis site were evaluated and compared for the epineural suture (right side) and fibrin glue (left side). The data were analyzed using the paired t test and univariate analysis of variance. Results: The mean postoperative nerve conduction velocity was 29.87 +/- 7.65 m/s and 26.75 +/- 3.97 m/s on the right and left side, respectively. No statistically significant difference was found in the postoperative nerve conduction velocity between the 2 techniques (P =.444). The proportion of nerve fibers that crossed the anastomotic site was 71.25% +/- 7.59% and 72.25% +/- 8.31% on the right and left side, respectively. The histologic evaluation showed no statistically significant difference in the proportion of the nerve fibers that crossed the anastomotic site between the 2 techniques (P =.598). Conclusions: The results suggest that the efficacies of epineural suturing and fibrin gluing in peripheral nerve anastomosis are similar. \u00a9 2012 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.",

Methods In a preliminary study, five pieces of vancomycin-impregnated fibrin sealant, five nuts that were not treated with the sealant, and five nuts that were treated with the sealant were subjected to agar diffusion testing. In a clinical study, the rates of deep SSI were compared between 188 patients who underwent procedures involving spinal instrumentation without AFS (group 1) and 196 patients who underwent procedures involving spinal instrumentation with AFS (group 2). Results All five pieces of vancomycin-impregnated fibrin sealant and the five nuts treated with the sealant exhibited antimicrobial efficacy, while the five untreated nuts did not exhibit antimicrobial efficacy in the agar diffusion test. In the clinical study, 11 (5.8 %) of the 188 patients in group 1 acquired a deep SSI, while none (0 %) of the 196 patients in group 2 acquired a deep SSI. Conclusion The present study demonstrated that the application of AFS to spinal instrumentation yielded good clinical outcomes in terms of the prevention of postoperative spinal infections. It is hoped that limiting AFS use to patients requiring spinal instrumentation and those with risk factors for SSI will reduce the overall costs while preventing SSIs. \u00a9 Springer-Verlag 2012.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Using hemostatic agents is one of the options to avoid complications during laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (LPN). Microporous polysaccharide hemispheres are made entirely from purified potato starch that activates the clotting cascade via a unique mechanism that hyperconcentrates platelets and coagulation proteins. We compare the efficacy of this new hemostatic agent, MPH and the standard hemostatic agent, fibrin glue. METHODS: Between January 2007 and October 2011, 70 LPNs with hilar clamping were completed by a single surgeon in Yokohama City University Hospital. We compare two sequential groups of patients: group A consisted of 27 patients in whom MPH was used and group B consisted of 43 patients in whom fibrin glue was used. These agents (MPH and fibrin glue) were applied to the partial nephrectomy bed before tying a suture in parenchymal suturing and after the renal hilum was unclamped. Study variables included blood loss, ischemic time and perioperative complications. RESULTS: Group A showed significantly less mean estimated blood loss (29.8 vs. 86.3 ml; p = 0.004) and less mean ischemic time (21.4 vs. 28.5 min; p = 0.002) than these of group B. Postoperative complications occurred in two patients in group B, but there were no postoperative complications in group A. CONCLUSIONS: MPH is available as an adequate hemostatic agent during LPN.

Case Information: A 43-year-old female with severe spasticity from Multiple Sclerosis underwent uncomplicated placement of an intrathecal baclofen pump. After 1 week the patient noted pain and swelling in her lumbar region, associated with mild positional headaches. A fluid-filled mass was found under her healed incision. Evaluation of the mass confirmed it as a sterile CSF seroma. The seroma worsened over 4 weeks of conservative management and an epidural blood patch was performed without improvement, followed by a second blood patch with injection of doxycycline into the seroma pocket to stimulate tissue adherence. Again the seroma reformed. After months of failed conservative treatment the patient returned to the OR for catheter revision, where the anchor was noted to be loose. It was secured and oversewn with fascia to prevent seroma formation. After several days the seroma reformed, with worsening of the patient's positional headache. A third blood patch was unsuccessful. We performed a percutaneous dural patch under fluoroscopic guidance by injecting fibrin glue into the epidural space. By 2 days post-procedure the patient reported significant improvement in her headache without redevelopment of the CSF leak or headache at 6 months follow-up.

    "has_full_text": "no",
    "abstract": "Background: For dural plasty, several kinds of substitute materials are used clinically. Among these materials, pericranium is often used as a dural substitute since it is autologous and easy to harvest. However, it is rather thin and fragile, which makes it difficult to suture onto peripheral dura mater, especially when the defect is large. Objective: We present a simple method of reinforcing the pericranium with fibrin sealant, which facilitates easier handling and suturing of the pericranium. Methods: Fifteen patients who underwent surgical removal of meningioma, metastatic brain tumor and glioma attached to the dura mater were included in this analysis. To close the defects, we use 'fibrin-sealed pericranium'. Herein we describe the method we employed in these cases. First, a standard skin flap is made by dissecting the subgaleal layer, leaving the periosteum on the bone. Second, fibrin sealant is evenly applied to the pericranium. Finally, the pericranium is cut along the reinforced area and dissected from the bone. The harvested pericranium is then used for closure of the dural defect. Some of these patients received further treatment as needed according to each pathology. The fibrin-sealed pericranium was examined histopathologically. Results: Fibrin-sealing of pericranium made it durable enough to be handled and sutured easily. There were no significant complications or treatment failures, such as infection or CSF leakage. Conclusions: Reinforcement of the pericranium with fibrin sealant is a simple and easy method to reduce the stress of dural plasty. \u00a9 2011 Springer-Verlag.",

Our single center study was performed to determine the incidences of CSF leaks after microsurgical removal of vestibular schwannoma via a retrosigmoidal approach with two different surgical closure techniques. Methods: Between January 2003 and December 2009 in 81 patients, microsurgical tumor resection using a suboccipital, retrosigmoidal approach was performed with an interdisciplinary ENT and neurosurgical management was performed. In 41 cases, the dural closure was done using a sandwich technique: subdural closure with TissuFleece respectively Spongostan, and after that dural suture and epidural Tachosil were fixed on. In 40 cases, the dura was sealed epidurally with Tachosil after suture. In 65 cases, the posterior wall of the petrous bone was drilled. The closure was performed using muscle and FibrinGlue. All patients had a minimal follow-up of 1 year. Results: Seven patients (8.6%) developed a CSF fistula. Three patients (3.7%) underwent surgical procedure because of persisting CSF fistula while in four cases (4.9%) spontaneous closure under lumbar drain was observed. Comparing the different techniques of dural sealing, we found in 41 patients with sandwich technique three CSF leaks (7.3%) while there were four CSF leaks (10%) in 40 patients with a single epidurally sealed dural closure (P50.69). No rhinorrhea or otorhinorrhea was observed. No intracranial infection or meningitis in case of CSF leak occurred. Conclusion: Suture and occlusion of the dura is an important step to prevent CSF leak and postoperative infection.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although often asymptomatic, enlarging sacral arachnoid cysts can also cause significant discomfort. These symptomatic sacral arachnoid cysts require specific treatments to facilitate local decompression. The main drawback of the surgical managements is the high risk of recurrence and complications. To decrease risks, we had been attempting to seek a simple and safe method to manage the symptomatic sacral arachnoid cysts. CT-guided percutaneous fibrin glue therapy is a new nonsurgical alternative. To evaluate the efficacy of the novel nonsurgical approach, we conducted this retrospective study of 38 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-eight patients with symptomatic sacral arachnoid cysts underwent fibrin glue therapy in our hospital between June 2006 and May 2009. The clinical results of improvement in pain and neurologic function were evaluated after an average of 25 months of follow-up, and changes on the imaging findings were evaluated. Preoperative and postoperative pain severity was assessed according to a 10-cm VAS. Moreover, we also analyzed the postoperative complications. RESULTS: Most patients experienced some degree of pain relief and functional improvement after fibrin glue therapy, with most experiencing complete or marked resolution of clinical symptoms. Twenty-one patients (55.3%) reported excellent recovery, 12 (31.5%) reported good recovery, 4 (10.5%) reported fair recovery, and 1 (2.6%) reported poor recovery. The overall percentage of positive outcomes (excellent and good recovery) was 86.8%. No serious postoperative complications were discovered.

The study aimed to verify the safety and feasibility of applying acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) with fibrin glue in combination with surgical neurolysis for nonacute spinal cord injury. Methods. This open-label, prospective, uncontrolled human clinical trial recruited 60 patients with spinal cord injuries (30 cervical and 30 thoracolumbar). The mean patient age was 36.5 +/- 15.33 (mean +/- SD) years, and the male/ female ratio was 3:1. The mean time from injury to treatment was 25.7 +/- 26.58 months, and the cause of injury included motor vehicle accident (26 patients [43.3%]), fall from a height (17 patients [28.3%]), sports (4 patients [6.7%]), and other (13 patients [21.7%]). Application of aFGF with fibrin glue and duraplasty was performed via laminectomy, and an adjuvant booster of combined aFGF and fibrin glue (2 ml) was given at 3 and 6 months postsurgery via lumbar puncture. Outcome measurements included the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) motor scores, sensory scores, impairment scales, and neurological levels. Examination of functional independence measures, visual analog scale, MR imaging, electrophysiological and urodynamic studies, hematology and biochemistry tests, tumor markers, and serum inflammatory cytokines were all conducted. All adverse events were monitored and reported. Exclusions were based on refusal, unrelated adverse events, or failure to participate in the planned rehabilitation. Results. Forty-nine patients (26 with cervical and 23 with thoracolumbar injuries) completed the 24-month trial. Compared with preoperative conditions, the 24-month postoperative ASIA motor scores improved significantly in the cervical group (from 27.6 +/- 15.55 to 37.0 +/- 19.93, p < 0.001) and thoracolumbar group (from 56.8 +/- 9.21 to 60.7 +/- 10.10, p < 0.001). The ASIA sensory scores also demonstrated significant improvement in light touch and pinprick in both groups: from 55.8 +/- 24.89 to 59.8 +/- 26.47 (p = 0.049) and 56.3 +/- 23.36 to 62.3 +/- 24.87 (p = 0.003), respectively, in the cervical group and from 75.7 +/- 15.65 to 79.2 +/- 15.81 (p < 0.001) and 78.2 +/- 14.72 to 82.7 +/- 16.60 (p < 0.001), respectively, in the thoracolumbar group. At 24-month follow-up, the ASIA impairment scale improved significantly in both groups (30% cervical [p = 0.011] and 30% thoracolumbar [p = 0.003]). There was also significant improvement in neurological level in the cervical (from 5.17 +/- 1.60 to 6.27 +/- 3.27, p = 0.022) and thoracolumbar (from 18.03 +/- 4.19 to 18.67 +/- 3.96, p = 0.001) groups. The average sum of motor items in functional independence measure also had significant improvement in both groups (p < 0.05). The walking/wheelchair locomotion subscale showed increased percentages of patients who were ambulatory (from 3.4% to 13.8% and from 17.9% to 35.7% in the cervical and thoracolumbar groups, respectively). There were no related adverse events. Conclusions. The use of aFGF for spinal cord injury was safe and feasible in the present trial. There were significant improvements in ASIA motor and sensory scale scores, ASIA impairment scales, neurological levels, and functional independence measure at 24 months after treatment. Further large-scale, randomized, and controlled investigations are warranted to evaluate the efficacy and long-term results.",

The withstand pressure of fibrin glue sealant was measured using a simple sellar reconstruction model. Methods A 15-mm diameter hole at the bottom of a 51-cm high cylinder was covered with a Gore-Tex (Gore-Tex, Tokyo, Japan) sheet. A small plate was placed on the center for a brief fixation, and 3 mL of fibrin glue was applied over the entire bottom. Then water was gradually filled in five cylinders, and the water level at leakage was measured as withstand pressures at 10 minutes and 24 hours after sealant application. The stability of the sealant under pressures of 20 and 30 cm H<inf>2</inf>O for 12 hours was also examined. Results The median initial withstand pressure at 10 minutes was 32 cm H<inf>2</inf>O (n = 5), and was significantly increased to 47.5 cm H<inf>2</inf>O after 24 hours (n = 4). In four of five cylinders, fibrin glue sealants were stable against a pressure of 20 cm H<inf>2</inf>O for 12 hours and 30 cm H<inf>2</inf>O for the next 12 hours. Conclusions The withstand pressure of simple fibrin glue sealant without other biological reactions could be estimated to be more than 20 cm H <inf>2</inf>O after application, and increased to more than 40 cm H<inf>2</inf>O after 24hours. These data are practical for neurosurgeons to comprehend the strength and limit of fibrin glue sealant and suggests the importance to control the intracranial pressure to less than 20 cm H<inf>2</inf>O, especially for the first 12 to 24 hours. \u00a9 2010 Elsevier Inc.",

Recently, inducible pluripotent stem (iPS) cells showed potential for multilineage differentiation and provide a resource for stem cell-based therapies. However, whether iPS transplantation could improve the function of stroke-like model is still an open question. The aim of this study is to investigate the therapeutic effects of subdural transplantation of iPS mixed with fibrin glue (iPS-FG) on cerebral ischemic rats induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). We demonstrated an efficient method to differentiate iPS into astroglial-like and neuron-like cells which display functional electrophysiological properties. In vivo study firstly showed that the direct injection of iPS into damaged areas of rat cortex significantly decreased the infarct size and improved the motor function in rats with MCAO. Furthermore, we found that the subdural iPS-FG can also effectively reduce the total infarct volume and greatly improve the behavior of rats with MCAO to perform rotarod and grasping tasks. Importantly, analysis of cytokine expression in iPS-FG-treated ischemic brains revealed a significant reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and an increase of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Taken together, these results suggest that iPS cells could improve the motor function, reduce infarct size, attenuate inflammation cytokines, and mediate neuroprotection after ischemic stroke. Subdural iPS-FG could be considered as a more safe approach because this method can avoid iatrogenic injury to brain parenchyma and enhance recovering from stoke-induced impairment. \u00a9 Copyright 2010, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: Epidural fibrosis, which develops during the post-operative period in 6-20% of the patients who undergo lumbar spinal surgery, can cause persistent low-back pain and signs of root compression. Conservative treatment protocols or repeat operations performed for the symptoms of epidural fibrosis are long-term and costly treatments and impairs the patient's quality of life. In this experimental study, we applied methyl prednisolone acetate mixed with fibrin glue to the surgical field and examined the effects on epidural fibrosis in the surgical field by delaying the absorption of methyl prednisolone acetate. Methods: One hundred Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into five groups, and animals underwent total laminectomy of L4 and L5. We applied 0.05 ml/kg fibrin glue, 0.05 ml/kg methyl prednisolone acetate, 0.05 ml/kg fibrin glue + methyl prednisolone acetate and 0.10 ml/kg fibrin glue + methyl prednisolone acetate topically to the operative sites. Normal saline was applied in the control group. Following the surgery, animals were killed at weeks 1, 2, 4 and 6, and laminectomy sites were examined histopathologically for fibrosis, acute inflammation, necrosis and abscess formation. Results: None of the options had a statistically significant transcendence over others in terms of preventing epidural fibrosis. Conclusion: Many biological and non-biological materials have been tried in a quest to prevent epidural fibrosis. However, inducing least amount of injury to the anatomy of the tissues and a very good hemostasis seem to be the most effective methods in the prevention of epidural fibrosis. \u00a9 2010 Maney Publishing.",

Occipital craniectomy and C1 laminectomy were performed for foramen magnum decompression. Intraoperative ultrasonography, performed after removal of the outer membrane of the dura mater at the level of the foramen magnum, revealed insufficient decompression. Therefore, the dura mater was completely opened and duraplasty was performed with a polyglycolic acid patch and fibrin glue. Sufficient decompression was thus achieved. The neurological symptoms and signs improved within the first postoperative month, and magnetic resonance showed a decrease in the size of the syrinx and no cerebrospinal fluid leakage.

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak is an unavoidable consequence of cranial surgery with leak rates between 0% to 25% and resulting costs ranging from 9,000 to 36,000. The use of polyethylene glycol (PEG) hydrogel dural sealant as an adjunct to sutured closure has been shown to reduce CSF leak rates as compared with sutures alone in cranial procedures (GR Cosgrove et al, 2007). Our hypothetical analysis applied the potential cost offsets of using PEG hydrogel sealant as an adjunct to sutured closure in 200 cranial procedures assuming CSF leak rates of 4.5% (9/200) (GR Cosgrove et al, 2007), compared with 10% (20/200) for fibrin sealant (JA Grotenhuis, 2005). METHODS: The incremental additional cost for treating CSF leaks using total patient costs for those with CSF leaks (25,253) compared to those without CSF leaks (10,497) was estimated at 14,756 in a Dutch study (JA Grotenhuis, 2005). We applied this CSF leak cost to estimate potential UK hospital cost offsets on 200 hypothetical cranial patients using PEG hydrogel sealant (300/treatment), compared with fibrin sealant (133/treatment) on all 200 patients. RESULTS: Use of a PEG hydrogel sealant compared with fibrin sealant could potentially save 137,611 (or 688/patient) for a hospital that performed 200 cranial surgery procedures using a PEG hydrogel sealant compared with using fibrin sealant on all 200 procedures. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the potential economic advantages of using a PEG hydrogel sealant in cranial procedures. Future clinical direct comparative studies would be beneficial to confirm these findings and understand the possible economic advantages for other types of dural surgeries.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND CONTEXT: The establishment of a watertight closure of the dura mater following spinal surgery is critical as post operative cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) leaks may cause medical complications, increased length of hospital stay, reduced quality of life, and added costs. PURPOSE: Our study assessed the added cost of CSF leaks following spinal surgery through Premier's PerspectiveTM Database (PPD), and applied the potential cost offsets of using a polyethylene glycol (PEG) hydrogel sealant (Covidien, Waltham, MA) compared with fibrin sealant. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: We assumed post-operative CSF leak rates of 6.8% and 11.1%, respectively, based on results from a randomized, controlled, multi-center clinical trial (RCT) of a PEG hydrogel sealant compared with methods of dural sealing including fibrin sealants. METHODS: The PPD was used to establish the costs of CSF leaks following spinal surgery using ICD-9 codes for spinal procedures discharged between Q4 2006 and Q3 2008. PPD is the largest clinical and economic database developed for quality and utilization benchmarking. We then performed a hypothetical analysis for a hospital that performed 100 spinal procedures using a PEG hydrogel sealant ($580/treatment, Company List Price) on all 100 patients compared with fibrin sealant ($236/treatment, Company List Price) on all 100 patients. Our analysis then multiplied the post-operative CSF leak rates from the RCT for 100 hypothetical spinal procedures resulting in expected numbers of CSF leaks of 7 and 11 for PEG hydrogel sealant and fibrin sealant, respectively. The expected number of CSF leaks for each group was then multiplied by the cost for CSF leaks in spinal procedures from the PPD analysis. The expected cost of CSF leaks in each group was then added to the total treatment costs for 100 spinal procedures in each group. RESULTS: We found the average cost of spinal surgeries with CSF leaks to be significantly higher at $25,812 (+/-35,977) compared with $19,333 (plusmn;22,772) for spinal surgeries without CSF leaks (p<0.0001) corresponding to an incremental additional cost of $6,479 per CSF leak. The cost difference was largely due to increased length of hospital (2.6 days), intensive care unit (ICU, 0.8 days), and pharmacy costs for CSF leaks. The total costs (eg, expected cost of CSF leaks in each group + treatment costs) for PEG hydrogel sealant and fibrin sealant for 100 hypothetical spinal procedures were $103,353 and $94,869, respectively. Therefore, the use of a PEG hydrogel sealant would cost an additional $85 per patient ($8,484 over 100 patients) for a hospital that performed 100 spinal procedures using a PEG hydrogel sealant compared with fibrin sealant on all 100 procedures. CONCLUSIONS: For a small incremental additional cost per patient, the use of a PEG hydrogel sealant may provide improved outcomes with respect to post-operative CSF leaks compared to fibrin sealant.",

    "abstract": "Background: Reconstruction of post-traumatic, full-thickness calvarial bone defects is needed to provide brain protection, to restore aesthetic contours, and to correct intracranial ventricular collapse. The two most widely used materials, autogenous bone graft and methyl methacrylate, are not ideal. Much effort has been directed to the development of osteoconductive materials composed of various calcium phosphate compounds. However, as an osteoinductive agent is needed to favor bone regeneration, there is interest in the use of growth factors (GF) - rich platelet materials in this indication. Aim: Evaluate a bone graft substitute obtained by combining hydroxy-apatite/s-tricalcium phosphate (HA/s-TCP) with human platelet glue rich in growth factors. Methods: The safety and efficacy of (HA/s-TCP)-platelet glue to reconstruct post-traumatic, full-thickness, calvarial bone defects was evaluated in 6 consecutive patients (5 males and 1 female; 26-66 years). Interval between injury and reconstruction ranged from 6 months to 4 years. Equal volumes of single-donor platelet-rich-plasma and cryoprecipitate were mixed with HA/s-TCP. Twice the volume of human single-donor thrombin was then added and the mixture was gently stirred for a few seconds, quickly consolidating into a firm moldable paste. The paste was applied to the bone defect and shaped using simple finger pressure. The HA/s-TCP granules were carefully compacted to prevent the formation of dead spaces. Once the desired bone contour had been achieved, a closed suction drain was placed through a separate stab incision well behind the reconstructed site. Single-donor fibrin glue was sprayed to facilitate hemostasis, the wound was closed and a pressure dressing applied. Patients were followed for 28-48 months subsequent to surgery (mean period: 30 months). Post-operative evaluation included serial photography, repeated physical examinations, and three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) scan performed 2 years subsequent to surgery. Results: High fibrin concentration of the platelet glue allowed easy molding and sculpting of the scaffold, providing mechanical stability and avoiding spillage of the granules into the operating field. The HA/s-TCP-human platelet glue paste demonstrated good tissue biocompatibility in all 6 patients. No infection of the surgical site or extrusion of HA/s-TCP was observed. The contour of the reconstructed calvarium was esthetically acceptable during the follow-up period. No secondary depression resulting from resorption of the HA/s-TCP was noted. There was no visible thinning of the overlying skin or sharp edges at the HA/s-TCP host bone interface. Three dimensional CT scans taken 2 years subsequent to reconstruction revealed good reconstruction of the bone defect in all six patients. Visual inspection of the reconstructed calvarium 2 years after surgery in one patient evidenced conversion of the scaffold into solid new bone. Section of the biopsy demonstrated new bone formation at the expense of the scaffold. Conclusion: Combining an osteoconductive scaffold with single-donor growth factor-rich platelet glue offers an interesting alternative to autogenous bone graft or methyl methacrylate for post-traumatic calvarium bone defect reconstruction.",

The animals were randomized into a fibrin glue group (n = 5) and a control group (n = 5). Seven days later, endoscopic examination assessed for CSF leaks. The skull bases were harvested and examined for the degree of graft adherence (graded I-V) and subjected to burst pressure testing and histopathological analysis. Results: Eight animals survived, four in each group. There were no CSF leaks in the fibrin glue group and one in the control group. The fibrin glue group showed greater graft adherence (P = 0.029) and higher burst pressures (13.8 +/- 5.4 vs 4.6 +/- 3.1 psi, P = 0.021). Histopathological analysis revealed no difference in inflammation and bone remodeling. Conclusions: The porcine model is a good model for anterior skull base defects.

    "abstract": "The treatment of root injury is typically performed at the more chronic stages post injury, by which time a substantial number of neurons have died. Therefore, before being applied in the clinical setting, a treatment strategy for these lesions should prove to be as effective in the chronic stages of injury as it is in the acute stage. In this study, we simulated the most severe clinical scenarios to establish an optimal time window for repair at a chronic stage. The sixth to eighth cervical roots on the left side of female SD rats were cut at their junction with the spinal cord. One or three weeks later, the wound was reopened and these roots were repaired with intercostal nerve grafts, with subsequent application of aFGF and fibrin glue. In the control group, the wound was closed after re-exploration without further repair procedures. Sensory and motor functions were measured after the surgery. Spinal cord morphology, neuron survival, and nerve fiber regeneration were traced by CTB-HRP. Results showed that both the sensory and motor functions had significant recovery in the 1-week repair group, but not in the 3-week repair group. By CTB-HRP tracing, we found that the architecture of the spinal cords was relatively preserved in the 1-week repair group, while those of the control group showed significant atrophic change. There were regenerating nerve fibers in the dorsal horn and more motor neuron survival in the 1-week repair group compared to that of the 3-week group. It was concluded that treating transected cervical roots at a chronic stage with microsurgical nerve grafting and application of aFGF and fibrin glue can lead to significant functional recovery, as long as the repair is done before too many neurons die. \u00a9 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",

In this study, we assessed potential adverse effects, as well as functional and histological impact of FS and EC in subtotal hemisection of the thoracic spinal cord (SC) in rats. Methods: 124 male rats were randomly assigned to four main groups (n = 31): Sham (SH), Lesion only (L), fibrin sealant (GFS) and equine collagen group (GEC). SH animals received laminectomy only; all other animals underwent subtotal lateral hemisection at T9. Treatment consisted of application of FS or EC into the lesion gap in GFS and GEC, which was left empty in L. GFS, GEC, L and SH were each further divided into 4 subgroups: One subgroup, consisting of 10 rats was subjected to behavioural and reflex testing before surgery and followed up on days 1,7, 14, 21, 28 post op and then sacrificed. Haemalaun or cresyl violet (CV) was used to identify neutrophils in parasagittal cord sections which were obtained on day 1 (n = 7). Sections stained for quantification of microglia/macrophages using ED-1 on day 3 (n = 7), day 7 (n = 7) and day 28 (n = 7 out of 10).

The use of fibrin glue has multiple applications in surgery, but there is controversy about the use of fibrin glue as a bone enhancer. METHODS: The purpose of the study was to determinate the effectiveness of fibrin glue as a bone enhancer in posterolateral arthrodesis in New Zealand rabbits. Posterolateral arthrodesis was done in ten New Zealand rabbits at the level of L5-L6 using autologous bone graft in the right side (control side) and autologous bone graft plus fibrin glue in the left side (study side). The rabbits were harvested at 8 weeks, obtaining the lumbar spine for radiological, manual palpation and light microscopic analysis. RESULTS: Solid arthrodesis was obtained in 100% of the controls and in only 60% of the study animals. There were no differences among methods for determination of solid arthrodesis whether by radiological, manual palpation or light microscopic analysis. In 40% of non-unions, only in one (10%) was fibrocartilage obtained. In the remaining 30%, only inflammatory cells were obtained in the gap between the transverse process. CONCLUSIONS: Fibrin glue does not have a positive effect in the success of solid fusion in posterolateral arthrodesis in rabbits. The use of fibrin glue significantly decreased the rate of solid fusion; therefore, we do not recommend its use as a bone enhancer.",

The study suggests that facial nerve repair using fibrin glue and chitin tube has the advantages of being easier,faster and more stable.",

    "abstract": "Bovine tissues are now routinely used for dural closure in cranial and spinal surgery. The authors report the case of an 18-year-old woman with a history of myelomeningocele who had symptoms of tethered cord syndrome and presented to a regional hospital. At that hospital she underwent a cord untethering procedure. The spinal dura was closed with Durepair, a dural substitute derived from fetal bovine skin. Her postoperative course was complicated by a cerebrospinal fluid leak that was surgically repaired. Following this, she developed erythroderma, intermittent fevers, eosinophilia, and marked elevation in serum immunoglobulin E. She was then transferred to the authors' institution. A skin antigen test to beef was administered, which revealed a positive reaction. A radioallergosorbent test to beef also yielded positive results. She was taken to the operating room for removal of the bovine graft due to concern for an allergic reaction to the graft. The graft material showed evidence of eosinophilic infiltration. Her clinical symptoms and laboratory values all improved after surgery. To the authors' knowledge this is the first reported case of an allergic reaction to bovine-based dural substitutes.",

    "abstract": "Background: Previous studies are on in vitro culture of mesenchymal stem cell differentiation. Few studies on mesenchymal stem cell differentiation in vivo or effects of cofactor on their differentiation. Objective: To study the amniotic membrane-derived mesenchymal stem cell (AD-MSC) transplantation on behavior, spatial learning and memory in traumatic brain injury rats, and the abilities to nerve growth factor (NGF), biologic fibrin glue (BFG) in AD-MSC transplantation. Design, Time and Setting: The cytology in vivo controlled study was performed at the Medical College of Zhengzhou University from July 2006 to January 2007. Materials: The placenta from healthy normal full-term fetus was obtained from Department of Gynaecology and Obstetrics, First Affiliated Hospital, Zhengzhou University. A total of 90 Wistar rats were equally and randomly assigned into a sham operation group, a model control group, a cell transplantation group, a cell + NGF group, a cell + BFG group. Methods: Fetal amniotic membrane was harvested from the placenta by blunt dissection under a sterile condition, made into monoplast suspension by trypsinization, and purified by adherece. At the third passage, AD-MSCs were used. Rats in the sham operation group underwent perforation. Rats in other groups were established into models of traumatic brain injury using free-failing epidural impact method. At 1 day following model induction, 40 mu L saline was infused into injury sites in the model control group. An equal volume of saline containing 1x10<sup>7</sup> AD-MSCs were injected into rats in the cell transplantation group. Rats in the cell + NGF group were injected with 1x10<sup>7</sup> AD-MSCs and 0.5 mu g NGF for successively for 2 weeks. Rats in the cell + BFG group were infused with AD-MSCs and 40 mu L BFG. Rats in the sham operation group did not receive cell transplantation. Main Outcome Measures: Ethology score; Latency was measured using Morris water maze test. Neuron specific enolase and glial fibrillary acidic protein expression was observed by immunohistochemistry. Results: At 7 days after transplantation, behavior score was significantly higher in the cell transplantation group, cell + NGF group, cell + BFG group compared with the model control group. The increase was significantly lower in the cell transplantation group compared with the cell + NGF group and cell + BFG group (F=155.322, P < 0.05). At 3 weeks after the transplantation, the latency was significantly shorter in the cell transplantation group, cell + NGF group, cell + BFG group compared with the model control group. The shortened range was significantly smaller in the cell transplantation group compared with the cell + NGF group and cell + BFG group (F=22.678, P < 0.05). At 4 weeks following transplantation, AD-MSCs could differentiate into nerve cell in damage brain tissue, and express neural specific enolase and glial fibrillary acidic protein following combined transplantation of NGF and BFG (F=705.406, F=424.884, P < 0.05). Conclusion: AD-MSCs can improve behavior and spacial learning and memory abilities, express neural specific enolase and glial fibrillary acidic protein following differentiation. NGF and BFG may enhance efficacy of transplantation.",

Recently, a new sealing technique using a polyglycolic acid felt and fibrin glue (PGA felt sealant) has been developed to close dural or pleural defects in neurosurgery and thoracic surgery. Our purpose was to evaluate whether the PGA felt sealant would be safe and effective for closure of the gastrointestinal serosal mural defect in the digestive tract surgery. Method. We prepared an artificial gastrointestinal mural defect and artificial digestive fluids of pH 7.0 or pH 3.0. We measured the rupture pressure to compare the durability between the PGA felt sealant and fibrin glue sealant. On the basis of the experimental results, we performed an initial trial for the PGA felt sealant for suture reinforcement of gastrocutaneous fistula closure. Results. The PGA felt sealant and the fibrin glue sealant withstood pressure of over 300 and 107+/-13 mmHg in the pH 7.0 fluid, and 282+/-12 and 72+/-9 mmHg in the pH 3.0 fluid, respectively. In the clinical case, the patient could begin an oral intake 2 weeks after the fistula closure. Conclusion. We concluded that the PGA felt sealant was suitable as a serosa membrane substitute to close fistulas accompanied with a mural defect.",

Various methods to prevent postoperative CSF leakage are available, but immediate and tight dural closure is still difficult. The efficacy of a novel sellar repair was described. Methods: The sellar repair using absorbable PGA sheet and fibrin glue was applied to 18 consecutive patients with sellar tumors that include 13 pituitary adenomas, 2 craniopharyngiomas, 2 Rathke's cleft cysts, and 1 meningioma within 135 patients who were treated with endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal approach. The reaction speed and strength between PGA sheets and fibrin glue were examined in vitro. Results: Polyglactin acid sheets were adhered to the rabbit skin with fibrin glue within 3 minutes and withstood a pressure of more than 220 mm Hg. Postoperative CSF leakage of the patients was not observed in any patients, and excellent adhesion of the PGA sheets to surrounding mucosa was estimated by endoscopic observation after the surgery. Conclusions: Repair of the sellar floor with PGA sheet and fibrin glue is a safe and effective method to prevent postoperative CSF leakage, which decreases the necessity for lumbar drainage after the operation. \u00a9 2007 Elsevier Inc.

    "abstract": "Brain tumors such as glioblastoma reappear in their original location in almost 50% of cases. To prevent this recurrence, we developed a radiopharmaceutical system that consists of a gel applied immediately after surgical resection of a brain tumor to deliver local radiation booster doses. The gel, which strongly adheres to tissue in the treatment area, consists of fibrin glue containing the beta-emitters rhenium-188 and rhenium-186 in microsphere-bound form. Such microspheres can be prepared by short (2 h or less) neutron activation even in low neutron flux reactors, yielding a mixture of the two beta-emitters rhenium-188 (E<inf>max</inf> = 2.1 MeV, half life = 17 h) and rhenium-186 (E<inf>max</inf> = 1.1 MeV, half life = 90.6 h). The dosimetry of this rhenium-188/rhenium-186 fibrin glue system was determined using gafchromic film measurements. The treatment efficacy of the radioactive fibrin glue was measured in a 9L-glioblastoma rat model. All animals receiving the non-radioactive fibrin glue died within 17 +/- 3 days, whereas 60% of the treated animals survived 36 days, the final length of the experiment. Control animals that were treated with the same amount of radioactive fibrin glue, but had not received a previous tumor cell injection, showed no toxic effects over one year. The beta-radiation emitting rhenium-188/rhenium-186-based gel thus provides an effective method of delivering high doses of local radiation to tumor tissue, particularly to wet areas where high adhesive strength and long-term radiation (with or without drug) delivery are needed. \u00a9 2006 Elsevier B.V.

    "abstract": "Object. The extended transsphenoidal approach to the suprasellar region has the advantages of minimal invasiveness and brain manipulation in the surgical treatment of small to medium lesions. At the same time, however, it carries a higher risk of postoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage and related complications than those for the standard transsphenoidal approach. Effective reconstruction of large skull base defects is a major concern in such extended approaches and remains challenging. Methods. Between January 2004 and April 2006, 21 patients affected by different suprasellar lesions underwent the extended endoscopic endonasal transtuberculum-transplanum approach. Three different techniques were used for the skull base reconstructions. In all cases, dehydrated human pericardium (Tutoplast) for dural reconstruction and a copolymer of L-lactic acid and glycolic acid (LactoSorb) as a bone substitute were used. Collagen sponges, fibrin glue, and an inflated Foley balloon catheter were also used to fill the sphenoid sinus cavity. Results. Two cases of postoperative CSF leaks (9.5%) and one case of mycotic sinusitis (4.8%) occurred following the intradural (inlay) and intraextradural (inlay-overlay) graft positioning. No cases of postoperative CSF leakage occurred in cases in which the extradural-only reconstruction procedure was applied. No meningitis or other complications related to the closure were noticed. Conclusions. The rate of postoperative CSF leakage after an extended approach to the suprasellar area is higher compared with that following standard pituitary surgery. Reconstruction after craniopharyngioma surgery exposes patients to an increased risk of postoperative CSF leaks. The extradural (overlay) technique was found to be the most effective in assuring a watertight closure.",

    "full_text": "Edited by: Alessandro Pesce, Hospital Santa Maria Goretti, ItalyReviewed by: Paul S. Page, Cleveland Clinic, United StatesClaudio Bernucci, Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, ItalyThese authors have contributed equally to this workThe Tarlov cysts are pathological enlargements of the cerebrospinal fluid spaces between the endoneurium and perineurium, which can cause intolerable sciatic pain, motor impairment of lower limbs, and bladder/bowel dysfunction. Currently, the treatment results are unsatisfactory due to the low cure rates and extensive surgical trauma. Thus, there is an ongoing exploration of surgical techniques for Tarlov treatment. In the current study, we present a novel neuroendoscopic-assisted technique that combines the fenestration, leakage sealing, and tamponade of the Tarlov cyst.Between January 2020 and December 2021, a total of 32 Tarlov patients were enrolled and received neuroendoscopic-assisted surgery. Their pre- and post-surgical Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores, major complaints, and MR imaging were recorded for comparison.27 of 32 patients (84.4%) patients demonstrated immediate pain relief as their VAS scores decreased from 5.6\u2009\u00b1\u20091.5 to 2.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.1 (p\u2009<\u20090.01) on the first day after surgery. At the 3-month follow-up, the patients' average VAS score continued to decrease (1.94\u2009\u00b1\u20090.8). Meanwhile, saddle paresthesia, urinary incontinence, and constipation were relieved in 6 (50%), 4 (80%), and 5 (41.7%), respectively, according to patients self-report. No surgical-related complication was observed in any of the cases.We conclude that neuroendoscopic-assisted surgery is an effective surgical method for symptomatic Tarlov cysts with minimized complications.The perineural cysts are also known as the Tarlov cysts since it was originally reported by Tarlov in 1938 as an incidental finding at autopsy (1). It is now known that the Tarlov cysts are pathological enlargements of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) spaces between the endoneurium and perineurium (2), which are most commonly identified in the sacral spinal canal between the nerve root origin and the dorsal root ganglion. While the exact pathogenesis remains uncertain, trauma seems to be pre-deposited in most Tarlov cases (3\u20136). Other causes may include inflammation, congenital origin, degeneration, and genetic inheritance (4). These factors result in a ball-valve structure, allowing CSF to influx from the normal subarachnoid space via pulsatile and hydrodynamic forces while restricting CSF efflux, which promotes the perineural cysts to fill and expand in size (7).The prevalence of Tarlov cysts was found to be 4.6%\u20139% in the overall population (5, 8). Despite the high prevalence, the Tarlov cysts are usually ignored during imaging exams because most patients are asymptomatic. Yet, there is a subset (approximately 1% or less) of Tarlov patients who tend to be symptomatic (8\u201310). The clinical presentations of symptomatic Tarlov cysts are related to S2, S3, or S4 compression, which leads to pain in the lower back, sacrococcygeal and perineal areas, somatic sensory disorder, functional impairment (motor weakness and claudication) of lower limbs, bladder and bowel dysfunction, and impotence (11\u201313). However the continuous research regarding the effect of various treatment options, there remains no consensus on the optimal therapy for symptomatic Tarlov cysts.In the current study, we aimed to report a new surgical technique by using the neuro-endoscope to treat Tarlov cysts.The current study is a single-center, non-blinded, prospective cohort study in a tertiary medical center. The research protocol was approved by the institutional ethics committee of Shanghai Chang Zheng Hospital (No.202009-N34). The authors asserted that all procedures contributing to this work comply with the ethical standards of the relevant national and institutional committees on human experimentation and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2008.Patients were recommended for surgery for the following indication: 1) patients presented Tarlov cyst related symptoms, and 2) the symptoms were not relieved due to medication failure, side effects, or complications.Patients were recruited into this study if they fulfilled the following inclusion criteria: (1)\u2009>18 years old; (2) presentation of clinical signs and symptoms (including pain in the lower back, sacrococcygeal and perineal areas, somatic sensory disorder, functional impairment of lower limbs, bladder and bowel dysfunction, and impotence); (3) the Tarlov cysts diagnosis was confirmed on magnetic resonance imaging; (4) no presence of any contraindication of lumbar surgery; and (5) voluntary provision of written informed consent.Individuals were excluded if they had multilevel lumbar disc disorder (>3), lumbar scoliosis, previous lumbar surgery, previous spine or pelvic fractures, vertebrate tumors or infectious diseases, and congenital spinopelvic anomalies. Overall, this study enrolled and reported the outcomes of the 32 patients who underwent surgery between January 2020 and December 2021.All patients received perioperative management as previously indicated (14). The surgery was performed under general anesthesia by endotracheal intubation. The patient was in a prone position on a standard operating table. A 5- to 10-cm midline incision was performed right above the Tarlov cyst. The subcutaneous tissue was gradually opened sharply on the midline until the medial sacral crest was observed. A standard sacral laminectomy was performed. Care is given since the sacral nerve root fibers are usually running under the site of laminectomy. The thin transparent cyst wall membrane was widely fenestrated longitudinally with a micro-scissor, where no nerve fibers were detected. The 30-degree endoscope was inserted into the cyst via the stoma, which provided a panoramic surgical view, especially allowing for clear observation of the cyst roof. Emphasis was also placed on careful observation of the nerve root fibers to avoid any iatrogenic injury. Sufficient cyst CSF drainage was required to decompress the spinal subarachnoid space, which was crucial for identifying the leakage point of the cyst. After the leakage point was identified, a muscle graft was obtained below the subcutaneous opening and positioned within this communication. Fibrin glue was used to keep the muscle graft in place while further strengthening the sealing effect. The remnant cyst space was tamponed with autologous fat obtained from the buttock. Since the leakage point had already been sealed, no attempt was made to perform complete cyst tamponade as excessive filling will cause compression to the nerve root. The sacral laminoplasty was performed by using a set of titanium mini-plates to replace the native lamina if necessary. The skin was closed in its corresponding layers.Two follow-ups are required. The first follow-up is performed on the first post-surgical date. The patients are asked to assess symptom relief regarding their primary discomfort before surgery. For those suffering from pain in the sacrococcygeal regions and/or lower extremities, the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) is ordered. Since the patients have not fully recovered, a physical examination is not performed during this follow-up session. During the second follow-up (3rd month post-surgical date), patients are asked about their recovery, followed by a thorough physical examination, especially focusing on the sacral spinal cord nerve function. In addition, the VAS and MR imaging of the lumbosacral spine are ordered to understand their recovery objectively as well as to compare with their pre-surgical status.The data was presented in the form of mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard\u2009deviation (SD). GraphPad\u00ae Prism 8.0 (GraphPad Prism Software Inc, San Diego, CA, USA) was used for statistical analyses. Pairwise comparisons of the groups in terms of VAS were carried out using the paired t-test. A statistically significant difference was defined as p\u2009<\u20090.05.Twenty female and 12 male participants aged 45.7\u2009\u00b1\u200912.9 took part in this study. Prior to surgery, the majority of patients (31 cases, 96.9%) reported pain in the sacrococcygeal regions and/or lower extremities as their main complaint, with Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores averaging 5.6\u2009+\u20091.5. Other reported complaints included saddle paresthesia (12 cases, 37.5%), urinary incontinence (5 cases, 15.6%), constipation (12 cases, 37.5%), and sexual dysfunction (1 case, 3.1%).On the first day after the surgery, 27 patients (84%) reported significant pain relief, whose VAS score was significantly dropped as compared to their pre-surgical score (2.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.1, p\u2009<\u20090.01). No surgical complication was observed in any of the patients. Fever was observed in 2 patients on the first post-surgical day. However, no infectious cause was identifiable. Since both patients presented excessive wound exudate, intravenous antibiotics and symptomatic treatment (amidopyrine & dexamethasone) were prescribed to prevent possible meningitis caused by either bacteria or fibrin. Patients' volume of wound exudate decreased significantly on the second post-surgical day, and their body temperature returned to normal after three days of administration.At the 3-month follow-up, the average VAS score of the patients decreased further (1.94\u2009\u00b1\u20090.8), which was significantly lower than their first post-surgical follow-up score (p\u2009<\u20090.05). According to the patients' self-report, saddle paresthesia, urinary incontinence, and constipation were relieved in 6 (50%), 4 (80%), and 5 (41.7%) cases, respectively. Sexual dysfunction persisted in 1 patient. There was no recurrence of cysts observed on MR imaging in any of the patients.We illustrated a 55-year-old female patient presented with a one-year history of pain in the sacrococcygeal region along with constipation. MR imaging of the lumbosacral spine demonstrated a 5.1\u2005cm\u2009\u00d7\u20092.8\u2005cm mass with homogenously bright signals on the T2-weighted sequence while dark signals on the fat-suppression sequence in the sacral canal (Figures\u00a01A\u2013C), which suggested the diagnosis of Tarlov cyst. The standard surgery as described was performed.The pre- and post-surgical MR image of a symptomatic Tarlov cyst patient (case 1). Before surgery, the T1-weighted (A), T2-weighted (B), and fat suppression (C) sequences indicated that a Tarlov cyst filled with cerebrospinal fluid was in the sacral canal. After the surgery, the fat tissue occupied the original space of the Tarlov cyst, and no cerebrospinal fluid was detected in the sacral canal anymore (D\u2013F), which indicated no recurrence of the Tarlov cyst.During the surgery, the leakage site was identified at the roof of the Tarlov cyst (Figure\u00a02), which was sealed by a muscle graft (Figure\u00a03). The remnant cyst space was tamponed with autologous fat obtained from the buttock (Figure\u00a04).The 30-degree endoscope was inserted into the Tarlov cyst via the stoma and identified the communication on the roof of the cyst (as indicated by the arrow).A muscle graft was obtained below the subcutaneous opening and positioned within the communication between the Tarlov cyst and subarachnoid space.The remnant cyst space was tamponed with autologous fat obtained from the buttock.On the first post-surgical date, the patient reported apparent relief in pain relief. At the 3rd-month follow-up, the patient reported total pain relief with an apparent resolution of constipation. Follow-up MRI did not demonstrate evidence of cyst recurrence (Figures\u00a01D\u2013F).A male patient, aged 48, visited our clinics due to a one-year history of back pain, erectile dysfunction, and urinary incontinence. A large Tarlov cyst (5.1*2.3\u2005cm) was detected at the S2-3 level on the lumbosacral MR (Figure\u00a05A). The patient received the surgery as described.The MR images of a patient with a symptomatic Tarlov cyst before and after surgery were presented (case 2). Before surgery, T2-weighted sequences (A) revealed the presence of a Tarlov cyst filled with cerebrospinal fluid in the sacral canal. Following surgery, the original space occupied by the Tarlov cyst was replaced by fat tissue (B).After observing the fistula on the roof of the Tarlov cyst (Figure\u00a06), we closed it with a muscle graft (Figure\u00a07) and filled the cyst cavity with fat tissue (Figure\u00a08). The patient reported relief from back pain on the first day after the surgery, and total pain relief was achieved at the second follow-up. The lumbosacral MR revealed no sign of cyst recurrence (Figure\u00a05B). While the patient experienced partial recovery from urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction persisted without improvement.The 30-degree endoscope was inserted through the stoma into the Tarlov cyst, identifying the communication on the cyst roof (as indicated by the arrow).A muscle graft was used to seal the communication between the Tarlov cyst and subarachnoid space.Fat tissue was used to tampon the cystic remnant.Pathologically, the Tarlov cyst is an abnormal enlargement of the CSF space, which features a ball-valve structure. This unique structure allows CSF to influx from the subarachnoid space while restricting CSF efflux, which keeps Tarlov size promotion. A consensus has been achieved that follow-up should be applied for asymptomatic Tarlov individuals. For symptomatic Tarlov cases, surgical intervention remains the only effective treatment option. However, due to the extensive sacral laminectomies and various unfavorable complications, clinicians are in desperate need of more promising surgical approaches for Tarlov cysts.Based on the therapeutic underlying logic, the available surgical procedures for Tarlov cysts could be categorized into two categories, which are cyst decompression (either from the cyst inside or outside) and resection. The cystic CSF drainage could decompress the Tarlov cyst from the inside. By inserting a lumboperitoneal shunt into the Tarlov, the cystic hydrostatic/pulsatile pressure decreases significantly, which subsequently lowers the pathological pressure on the nerve root and relieves patients' symptoms (15). However, lumboperitoneal shunt could not be appled to those with multiple nerve root cysts as it is very difficult to identify which cyst shows primary liability for patients' complaints. Additionally, shunt malfunction and infection are also severe complications that prevent this approach from being wildly adopted. Simple decompressive laminectomy is aimed to decompress the cyst from the outside, which however shows a low successful rate due to continuous expansion of the cyst after surgery (16). Cyst resection combined with either neck ligation or cyst wall imbrication demonstrates good outcomes. Nevertheless, due to significant bony loss during cyst resection, the patients may suffer from CSF leakage, nerve root damage, and worsening back pain. Incomplete cyst wall removal could also cause Tarlov cyst recurrence. Thus, neither of the decompression procedures has achieved optimal results so far.Computed tomography-guided percutaneous cyst drainage (CTG-PCD) is previously reported as a minimally invasive therapeutic for the Tarlov cyst. An early study reported instant relief of sciatica pain after CTG-PCD (8). However, the effect of CTG-PCD remains temporary and cysts usually recur within 3\u20136 months in most cases. Later, Patel et al. (17) administrated fibrin glue into the Tarlov cysts following CTG-PCD, and all four patients experienced total resolution or marked improvement of symptoms for as long as 23 months. This result was confirmed by several subsequent studies as they achieved similar results (12, 18\u201320). However the good outcomes, fibrin administration could lead to aseptic meningitis, clinically demonstrated as postprocedural fever and neck stiffness (17). Other complications may also include malaise, headache, nausea, vomiting, and local pain. Although this procedure so far seems to achieve optimal results, the related complications remain a major concern during its clinical usage.In the current study, we illustrate the technical aspects of the neuro-endoscopic approach in Tarlov cyst management. This procedure not only presents good therapeutic results but also eliminates major complications of previous surgery. Apparent pain relief was observed right after surgery as well as at 3rd month post-surgical period. Additionally, bladder and bowel function recovery were also reported. We believe this good outcome is achieved based on three mechanisms. Firstly, our surgical procedure could effectively decompress the Tarlov cyst. Tarlov patients' symptoms are caused by the pathological pressure on the nerve root from the cyst. Our procedure identifies and seals the communication of the Tarlo cyst. Thus, the CSF from normal subarachnoid space could no longer influx into the Tarlov cyst, which lowers the hydrostatic/pulsatile pressure and thus decreases pathological pressure on the nerve root. Secondly, our approach could effectively prevent the future recurrence of Tarlov. Previously, fibrin administration via CTG-PCD demonstrated a good clinical outcome. We utilize the characteristics of fibrin and ingeniously integrate it with autologous fat to further reinforce the sealing effect on the communication as well as the tamponade of the Tarlov cyst. Thus, double assurance on the leakage point and cyst closure enables us to achieve excellent therapeutic results as presented. Thirdly, the usage of the 30-degree endoscope provides surgeons with a panoramic surgical view, which decreases the possibility of nerve damage and thus lowers the incidence of surgical complications. These features of our procedure enable the good outcomes of Tarlov.Our study also has some limitations. Firstly, the small sample size and non-blind assessments may generate statistical bias, which requires future large research to confirm the results achieved from the current study. Secondly, although results from short-term follow-ups showed good outcomes, the long-term cure and recurrence rate are required from future follow-ups to verify this result. Thirdly, we did not perform an objective assessment of bladder and anal sphincter structure and function. Instead, a self-reported questionnaire was used to compare the symptoms of improvement regarding incontinence and constipation, which however is common in literature. In our future study, both urodynamics and anorectal manometry will be included to better assess the bladder and bowel function recovery after surgery, respectively. Additionally, although no surgical complication was observed, fever was observed in two patients in our study. Since our surgical procedures require durotomy, bacterial meningitis secondary to cerebrospinal fluid leakage becomes a primary suspect. Another possibility for the fever could be fibrin-related aseptic meningitis (17). Since literature demonstrated that infection is not a major cause of fever after spine surgery (21\u201323), we suspect that fever in our study could either be surgical-stress-, wound- or fibrin-related. A future study enrolling a large sample size is required to identify the exact cause of fever after neuro-endoscopic assisted surgery.In addition, we would like to highlight the fact that the results of the current study were obtained from a single-arm study. Thus, the conclusion was drawn based on a paired t-test comparison between pre- and post-operative patient data. In the absence of a control arm, precise data on the safety and efficacy of the current surgical technique remain to be determined.Conclusively, we reported a novel neuro-endoscopic assisted technique to treat Tarlov cysts, which combines the fenestration, leakage seal, and tamponade of the Tarlov cyst. This procedure provides prominent pain and symptom relief while demonstrating no surgical-related complications. Therefore, we believe this procedure could be an effective treatment option for Tarlov cyst.We want to express our sincere acknowledgment to all participants and individuals who helped us to finish the current study.The original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/Supplementary Material, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding authors.The studies involving humans were approved by The Ethics Committee of Shanghai ChangZheng Hospital.

    "abstract": "Aim: To observe the effect of fibrin glue at local use on the regeneration of peripheral nerve based on the suture. Methods: The experiment was conducted in the Central Laboratory of Dalian Medical University between March and July in 2005. Experimental materials: fibrin glue (Guangzhou Bioseal Biotech Co. Ltd. main component includes 50-70 mg/injection fibrinogen and 400 U/injection thrombin, purified from mammal blood, sterilized and freeze dried, without pyrogen). A total of 48 SD rats were randomly assigned into suture group and combination of suture and fibrin glue group, with 24 rats in each. All the rats were anesthetized to expose sciatic nerve by a 2-cm incision posterior to lateral left thigh, and sciatic nerve was cut off from 1.5 cm distally pidformis muscle and epineurial neurorrhaphy was performed with 10-0 non-trauma thread, with the interval of 1-2 mm. Combination group: Fibrin glue was injected into peripheral muscle of 2 symmetric sutures to produce the gel ring, the mixture curing lead to regeneration division. Suture group: Epineurial neurorrhaphy was performed only. Animal ethology was observed continuously postoperation: movement of lateral hind limb and toes, ulceration, ulcer healing of toes and toe nail, reflection of unfold claws. Four rats from each group were selected for electrophysiologic study and detect the nerve conduction velocity and latency at 8 weeks postoperation. At 2, 4, 6, 8 weeks postoperation, two rats of each group stained with hematoxylin-eosin were observed under light microscope for nerve regeneration. Eight weeks postoperation, four rats of each group was adopted to analyze the number and diameter of axon in toluidine blue-stained nerve tissue slices by means of LUZEX-F color image analyzer, determine the axonal regeneration in slices that were stained with both lead citrate and uranyl acetate using Philip-10 transmission electron microscope, and assay the motor neuron in anterior cornu of medullar spinalis, which was labeled with horseradish peroxidase (HRP), respectively. Results: All the 48 rats were involved in the result analysis. 1 Animal ethology: Except a little toe ptosis and flexion 8 weeks postoperation, the gait, reflection of unfold claws and activity of hind limb were found in the combination group, while those of suture group were fair. 2 Electrophysiologic analysis: At 8 weeks postoperation, the nerve conduction velocity of combination group was significantly higher and latency was shorter than that of the suture group [(11.13+/- 0.37), (9.26+/-0.44) m/s, (1.83+/-0.18), (2.17+/-0.19) ms, F=27.78, 5.53, P < 0.05]. 3 Neural regeneration under light microscope: Myelinated nerve fiber presented thick myelin sheath, long diameter, tight arrangement and good regeneration in the combination group, whereas unsatisfactory effect was found in the suture group. 4 Axonal number and diameter was more in the combination group than in the suture group [(2 187+/-107), (1 847+/-96) axons/400 field of vision; (2.79+/-0.15), (2.05+/-0.17) mum], with the significant difference (F=80.70, 42.92, P < 0.05). 5 Axonal regeneration was observed under transmission electron microscope: At 8 weeks postoperation, the regenerative axon grow well and arranged orderly in the combination group, additionally both the axonal diameter and myelin sheath thickness were identical, axons were evenly staining, Schwann cellular nucleus in oval shape was also presented. While in the suture group, axonal growth was different, their arrangement was in disorder, and the myelin sheath was thin, accompanying the vascular dilation and partly area of bleeding and edema. 6 HRP-labeled motor neuron in anterior cornu of medullar spinalis: HRP-labeled motor neurons were found in anterior cornu at a greater quantity in the combination group, whereas few in the suture group. Conclusion: Fibrin glue can obviously improve the repair and regeneration of injured peripheral nerve, and the effect is superior to that of simple suture.",

    "abstract": "STUDY DESIGN: A prospective randomized study evaluating the efficacy of autologous fibrin tissue adhesive for decreasing postoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak in spinal cord surgery. OBJECTIVE: To compare postoperative CSF leak in 3 groups (i.e., autologous fibrin tissue adhesive used, commercial fibrin glue used, and no fibrin tissue adhesive used) of patients undergoing spinal surgery who needed dural incision. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Spinal cord operations, particularly when dural incision is inevitable, sometimes involve postoperative CSF leak. Because CSF leak is a serious complication, countermeasure is necessary to prevent it after dural suture. Commercial fibrin tissue adhesive was formerly used. Because the possibility of prion infection was widely noticed, commercial fibrin tissue adhesive containing animal components has been used less often. METHODS: In 13 of 39 cases in which dural incision would be made, 400 mL whole blood was drawn, and autologous fibrin tissue adhesive was made of plasma. Cases were divided into 3 groups: (1) dural closure alone, (2) use of autologous fibrin tissue adhesive after dural closure, and (3) use of commercial fibrin tissue adhesive after dural closure. The primary outcome measure was determined as postoperative (3 days) volume of drainage fluid, and results were analyzed using the analysis of variance. The secondary outcome measure was general blood test, coagulation assay, and plasma fibrinogen, and these were analyzed also using the analysis of variance. RESULTS: There was a significant difference in the primary outcome between the autologous and control groups. No complications such as infection or continuous CSF leak were observed in any case. The mean volume of drainage fluid was 586.2 mL in the group with autologous fibrin tissue adhesive and 1026.1 mL in the group without fibrin tissue adhesive. The volume of drainage fluid was significantly lower in the former group than that in the latter group. There was no statistical difference between the volumes of the group with autologous adhesive and with commercial adhesive (639.2 mL). CONCLUSIONS: We used autologous fibrin tissue adhesive as a new sealant after dural closure instead of commercial fibrin tissue adhesive. No definitive CSF leak was observed, and the volume of drainage fluid was significantly lower in the group with autologous fibrin tissue adhesive than that in the group without fibrin tissue adhesive. The use of autologous fibrin tissue adhesive was superior to that of commercial fibrin tissue adhesive in cost.",

The purpose of this study was to compare functional nerve responses following repair with either a traditional microsuture technique or Quixil human fibrin sealant. Thirty female Lewis rats received transection of the right sciatic nerve. Nerve repair was achieved with either epineurial microsuture (n = 15) or Quixil fibrin glue (n = 15). Functional results were assessed at 2, 6, and 12 weeks postoperatively with walking-track analysis. Electrophysiologic nerve recordings were also performed 12 weeks postoperatively. Rats receiving Quixil nerve repair returned to baseline performance on the walking-track analysis significantly faster than those with microsuture repairs (6 and 12 weeks postoperatively, p < 0.0001). Recovery of nerve conduction velocities and wave amplitudes was also significantly better in the nerves repaired with Quixil than in those repaired with microsuture (p's < 0.0001). Quixil human fibrin sealant is a good alternative to traditional microsuture nerve repair techniques. Copyright \u00a9 2006 by Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Background: In spinal surgery, repair of the dura is difficult when it is torn or fragile or is ossified as in cases with ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament. We report our experience with a nonsuture dural repair technique in patients undergoing spinal surgery; it uses a dura substitute composed of polyglycolic acid (PGA) mesh and fibrin glue. Here, we report the efficacy and safety of nonsuture duroplasty using PGA mesh and fibrin glue (PGA-fibrin sheet). Methods: The artificial dura mater is composed of a PGA-fibrin sheet. The dural defect is covered with a patch sprayed with fibrin glue without suturing to the dura mater. We first evaluated this technique in an experimental study by performing water leakage tests. Between May 2001 and January 2005, we used it in 160 spinal surgeries that required intraoperative dura repair. Results: Our preliminary tests showed that the threshold for water pressure without leakage was 161 +/- 42 and 96.5 +/- 32 mm Hg when the unsprayed margin around the perimeter of the patch was 5 and 2 mm, respectively. Of the 160 operated patients, 10 (6.3%) experienced subcutaneous cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage. Of these, 6 required a second operation; in the other 4, the CSF collection diminished spontaneously. There were no other complications such as allergic reaction, adhesion, or infection. Conclusion: In combination with CSF diversion, the PGA-fibrin sheet is a viable alternative method for dural repair in spinal surgery. \u00a9 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

    "abstract": "Background: Different techniques have already been described for reconstructing the sellar floor after transsphenoidal (TS) procedures. This paper reports on the use of fibrin glue alone without grafting or the use of implants in the reconstruction of the sellar floor after TS. Methods: Five hundred sixty-seven patients who submitted to TS for pituitary and sellar region tumors were studied. No intraoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak occurred in 503 patients (group 1); in the remaining 64 patients (group 2), intraoperative CSF leak was noted. In group 1 patients, closure of the sellar floor consisted of packing the surgical bed with hemostatic material only. When CSF leak was noted, the surgical bed was covered with a layer of hemostatic material and the intrasellar space was filled up with fibrin glue. An additional layer of hemostatic material was added at the topography of the preexisting sellar floor, and a second amount of fibrin glue was applied over it. At the end of surgery, a continuous lumbar CSF drainage system was installed in group 2 patients and kept for 5 days. Prophylactic antibiotics were administered during this period. Results: We did not observe delayed CSF leak, meningitis, or visual loss in group 1 patients. In group 2, 2 patients presented with complications: 1 patient got meningitis but no overt CSF leak, and the other disclosed a delayed postoperative leak treated by reoperation. Discussion: Our results showed that closure of the sellar floor with hemostatic material and fibrin glue without grafting or the use of implants is a safe and efficient method to prevent postoperative complications after TS. Generally speaking, there is no need for grafting or the use of implants at the end of TS. \u00a9 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

    "abstract": "Background: Some neurosurgical procedures have high morbidity and mortality rates due to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) fistula development, particularly when dural defects are in relatively inaccessible areas or surrounded by friable dura. We used a rat model to test 4 different dural closure techniques to determine which one was significantly superior for achieving a watertight dural closure with minimal harm to brain tissue. Methods: The rats were randomly divided into 2 groups. The first group (group A, n = 40) was used to test the strength of the adhesivity for CSF leakage. Histopathologic studies were used to evaluate the granulation tissue between the dura and dural graft. Effects on the brain tissue were studied in the second group (group B, n = 40) where lipid peroxidation was determined. These 2 groups consisted of 5 subgroups: control, methyl metacrylate, n-butyl cyanoacrylate, fibrin glue, and CO<inf>2</inf> laser. Results: Methyl metacrylate and CO<inf>2</inf> laser techniques were inadequate for stopping dural leakage and had harmful effects on brain tissue. Cerebrospinal fluid leak was observed only in 1 rat in the n-butyl cyanoacrylate subgroup and this result was statistically significant (P = .0005), but lipid peroxidation levels for this material showed that it was not safe for dural closure in case it leaked through the dural defect. The lipid peroxidation levels of the fibrin glue subgroup were not statistically significantly different from the control group (P = .440). Conclusions: Fibrin glue was the safest material with a CSF leakage risk that was higher than n-butyl cyanoacrylate (25% vs 12.5%) but acceptable. This study showed no relationship between the CSF leak and histopathologic findings for sealant properties of the tissue adhesives. \u00a9 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

METHODS: A rabbit skin model of dural defect was repaired using fibrin glue-covered polyglycolic acid fabric without suture and subjected to a water leakage test to investigate closing ability. In addition, the dural defects created on 12 hemispheres in 6 beagle dogs were repaired with the dural substitute and subjected to macroscopic and histological examination of the dural substitute and adjacent tissue 1 and 2 months later. RESULTS: The dural substitute showed a breaking pressure of 109.9 +/- 37.1 mmHg. Macroscopically, no cases of excessive granulation, infection, or liquorrhea, either on the dural substitute or surrounding tissue, were observed. Histology indicated favorable tissue replacement of the dural substitute with collagenous fiber, although slight foreign body reaction was associated with its absorption. There was no evidence for adhesion to the brain surface or influence on nerve cells. CONCLUSION: Dural substitute created using fibrin glue and polyglycolic acid fabric is advantageous in that it exerts excellent closing ability without requiring suture and can replace biological tissue without causing incompatibility.

In elderly patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), complications including vasosopasm, subdural effusion, and late hydrocephalus, are liable to occur even after aneurysmal surgery. We examined prospectively the efficacy of arachnoid plasty using fibrin glue membrane during surgery of ruptured aneurysms in the elderly patients for preventing complications. The effects on the modified Rankin scale (mRS) and the Glasgow outcome scale (GOS) 3 months after SAH were noted. Methods. Total of 31 patients aged more than 70 years selected from a consecutive series of patients with aneurysmal SAH, were divided into two groups alternately, a group with arachnoid plasty (n = 16) and a control group without arachnoid plasty (n = 15). Statistical analyses were performed to assess relationships among various clinical and neuroradiological variables, especially between arachnoid plasty and occurrence of symptomatic vasospasm, subdural effusion, late hydrocephalus, or outcome such as mRS and GOS 3 months after onset. Findings. Statistical analyses revealed that arachnoid plasty were associated with late hydrocephalus and subdural effusion negatively, but with better mRS at 3 months after SAH. A tendency to be associated with less frequent symptomatic vasospasm was also noted. Conclusion. Arachnoid plasty using fibrin glue is suggested to be effective in preventing complications associated with SAH and aneurysmal surgery. A better outcome in the elderly patients can be achieved. \u00a9 Springer-Verlag 2006.",

To evaluate the ability of fibrin glue to limit diffusion of recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein (rhBMP)-2 and its ability to protect spinal nerves from rhBMP-2 stimulated bone growth. Summary of Background Data. Studies have shown bone morphogenetic protein (rhBMP-2) stimulated bone growth can encroach on the spinal canal and nerves, causing neural compression. More recently, rhBMP-2 use in the cervical spine has been associated with life-threatening swelling. Fibrin glue has been used as a biologic carrier but has not been evaluated for its ability to limit rhBMP-2. Methods. In phase 1 of the study, rhBMP-2 soaked absorbable collagen sponges (ACS) were encapsulated in fibrin glue and immediately incubated in physiologic lactated ringers solution at 38deg;C. Samples of solution were tested for rhBMP-2 concentration. In phase 2 of the study, rats were surgically treated with laminectomy and placement of rhBMP-2/ACS versus laminectomy and placement of fibrin glue before placement of rhBMP-2/ACS. After 8 weeks, animals were euthanized and imaged using micro-computerized tomography. Results. The diffusion study showed a significant limitation in rhBMP-2 diffusion when encapsulated in fibrin glue. The laminectomy study revealed blockage of bone formation by fibrin glue and protection of the spinal canal. Conclusions. Fibrin glue can limit the diffusion of rhBMP-2, and, thus, it can be used to help protect the spinal canal and nerve roots from rhBMP-2 stimulated bone growth. \u00a92006, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Background. An ideal dural substitute that enables watertight closure, has sufficient strength, and can be absorbed without remnant materials that induce inflammation, adhesion, and infection is not available. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a bioabsorbable polyglycolic acid (PGA) mesh and fibrin glue as a substitute for dural repair. Methods. Altogether, 10 patients with noted dural tears during extradural spinal surgery and 20 patients who underwent durotomy for intradural spinal surgery were included in this study. In a series of 20 consecutive cases, dural closure was performed by suture and fibrin glue. In the subsequent 10 consecutive patients, dural closure was performed by suture and fibrin glue with the use of absorbable PGA mesh. The medical records and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the surgical site were retrospectively reviewed to evaluate the presence of a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) fistula or leakage after the surgery. Results. A CSF fistula occurred in five patients who underwent dural repair with fibrin glue alone, and postoperative MRI showed CSF leakage in two patients with incidental dural tears after laminectomy for ossification of ligamentum flavum. No CSF fistula was present in patients who underwent dural repair using PGA mesh and fibrin glue, and no adverse effects or complications were encountered postoperatively. Follow-up MRI revealed no evidence of CSF leakage around the reconstructed dura mater. Conclusions. The use of PGA mesh and fibrin glue for the repair of dura mater is a useful method of preventing CSF leakage in spinal surgery. \u00a9 2006 The Japanese Orthopaedic Association.",

Axonal regeneration was examined using histological and electrophysiological methods. The extent of axonal regeneration was superior when treated with autologous fibrin glue. Our data suggest that fibrin nets formed by fibrinogen, in combination with growth factors present in autologous fibrin glue, might effectively promote peripheral nerve regeneration in nerve defects. \u00a9 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

Objective: To evaluate the effect of fibrin glue (FG) containing vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) on re-endothelialization, cellular proliferation and intimal hyperplasia by using canine model of balloon angioplasty. Design: A randomized controlled repeated measurement design. Setting: Department of Vascular Surgery; Institute of Neurosurgery, Xijing Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University of Chinese PLA. Materials: The study was carried out in the Institute of Neurosurgery, Xijing Hospital Affiliated to Fourth Military Medical University of the Chinese PLA, between October 2002 and June 2004. Fifteen healthy adult mongrel dogs of either gender, with body mass of 12.5 to 18.9 kg, were provided by the Surgery Laboratory for Experimental Animals, Xijing Hospital. Methods: In the bilateral carotid artery, FG/VEGF/heparin of one side was set as treatment group and the other side was set as control group. The intimal injury and the treatment results were observed at three time points 10, 30 and 90 days after injury. Thickness of vascular intima and medial layer was measured with Bioquant BQ OS/2 computer morphology measuring instrument. Cell proliferation rate was quantitated by 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation by immunohistochemistry. BrdU positive cells were counted using 40 x magnification. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to evaluate the percentage of endothelial cell coverage on the luminal surface. Main outcome measures: Coverage of endothelial cells, neointimal and medial thickness, and cellular proliferation. Results: All the dogs survived till the collection of samples with no loss in the midway. 1 Coverage rate of endothelial cells: The arterial coverage rate at the treated side at days 10 and 30 was significantly higher than that at the control side [(66.73+/-30.78)%, (40.8+/-27.74)%, P=0.04; (96.67+/-10.29)%, (82.07+/-22.82)%, P=0.048]. 2 Proliferation of each vascular layer. It reached the peak at day 10 and recovered to normal at day 90. Compared with that of control group, cellular proliferation rate of neointima and the 1/2 of inside of media as well as media was significantly increased [(7.41+/-6.75)%, (3.56+/-2.72)%; (2.81+/-2.65)%, (0.83+/-0.59)%; (2.06+/-1.81)%, (0.62+/-0.31)%, P < 0.05]. 3 Thickness of neointima; Compared with that of control group, the thickness of intima/thickness of medial layer in both the proximal and the middle segments was significantly increased (0.18+/-0.22, 0.10+/-0.06; 0.21+/-0.23, 0.14+/-0.14; 0.12+/-0.08, 0.09+/-0.08; 0.29+/-0.40, 0.12+/-0.12, P < 0.05, P < 0.01), but there was no change in the distal segments. Conclusion: FG can distribute cytokines into the wall of injured arteries and retain the biological function of cytokines. VEGF plus heparin delivered by FG accelerates re-endothelialization concomitant with the proliferation of smooth muscle cell and intimal hyperplasia.",

To study the effects of GDNF on chronic FCI injury in conscious rats, we used fibrin glue (GDNF-fibrin glue) and fibrin glue free (GDNF-only)-GDNF topically applied to the ischemic brain after right middle cerebral artery (MCA) ligation. Infarct brain volume and functional motor deficits were measured before and after FCI injury. After FCI injury induced by right MCA ligation, rats were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups: (a) sham, (b) control, (c) topically applied GDNF (1 mug)-only, and (d) topically applied GDNF (1 mug)-fibrin glue. The degree of ischemic brain injury was estimated by infarct volume of right MCA territory at 4 weeks after occlusion. The functional motor deficits were quantified with rotarod test and grasping power test once a week. Topically applied GDNF-fibrin glue at infarct brain tissue after 4 weeks FCI injury significantly reduced the total infarct volume by 44.3% and 36%, respectively, compared to that of control group and GDNF-only group. The mean latencies for rats to stay on the rotarod were 55.0%, 50.3%, and 92.2% (P < 0.05 vs. control group and GDNF-only group) of baseline, respectively, in the control, GDNF-only, and GDNF-fibrin glue groups at the end of the 1st week after FCI injury but 75.3%, 67.3%, and 106.6% (P < 0.05 vs. control group and GDNF-only group) of baseline at the end of the 4th week after FCI injury. The mean values of grasping power were 78.7%, 71.7%, and 101.2% (P < 0.05 vs. control group and GDNF-only group) of baseline, respectively, in the control, GDNF-only, and GDNF-fibrin glue groups at the end of 1st week after FCI injury but 89.6%, 97.6%, and 120.7% (P < 0.05 vs. control group) of baseline at the end of 4th week after FCI injury. These results indicate that GDNF-fibrin glue not only reduced the total infarct volume after FCI injury but can also improve motor deficits after FCI injury. We concluded GDNF-fibrin glue could facilitate delivery of GDNF to the damaged brain tissue with subsequent reduction of ischemic brain injury accompanied by enhancing functional recovery in rats with chronic FCI injury. \u00a9 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Setting and materials: The study was completed in the Laboratory of Biodynamics, Department of Orthopaedics, Union Hospital of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology. The healthy adult male Wistar rats weighing 250-300 g were selected for the experiment. Interventions: Totally 96 Wistar rats were completely randomized into the suture group and the adhesion group. Their sciatic nerves were cut, and the incisions were well lined. The fibrin glue was adopted in the adhesion group, while 11-0 suture, was adopted in the suture group. On the very day and 3, 7, 14, 21, 28 days after the operation, 8 rats were respectively taken each from the suture group and the adhesion group. The free sciatic nerves of them were detected immediately by the biodynamic test. Main outcome measures: The peak load and the power consumption were measured when the nerves ruptured and the nerve stress-strain curve was described. Results: In normal countertraction intensity curve of the nerve, the elastic peculiarity can be manifested. Between the suture group and the adhesion group, there were no notable significances of the maximal countertraction intensity and power consumption on the very day and 14, 21, 28 days after the operation (P > 0.05). While 3 days after the operation, the maximal countertraction intensity of the two groups was (1.35 +/- 0.27), (1.97 +/- 023) N/mm<sup>2</sup> respectively, the power consumption was (0.028 +/- 0.007), (0.040 +/- 0.003) J/mm<sup>2</sup> respectively.

Inversion microscopic follow-up during culturing and the Alamar blue-essay found strong growth stimulation for oral mucosa fibroblasts on fibrin glue coated surfaces by insulin and FGF. Three-dimensional fibroblast growth was observed along the suture lines in the presence of fibrin glue. Conclusions. Fibrin glue is an attractive extracellular matrix for cellular migration from the dura which is suited to fibroblast culturing in suture nets.

    "abstract": "Peripheral nerve injury is often followed by incomplete recovery of function and sometimes associated with neuropathic pain. There is, therefore, need for therapies which improve the speed of recovery and the final functional outcome after peripheral nerve injuries. In addition, neuropathic pain is not easily dealt with clinically and should preferrably be eliminated. Neurotrophic factors have well-documented abilities to support neuron survival and stimulate neurite outgrowth, making them excellent candidates for use in repairing injured nerves. We investigated the possible beneficial effects of repairing the transected rat sciatic nerve by local application of a fibrin sealant containing nerve growth factor (NGF), glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), or acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF). Fibrin sealant was used in conjunction with sutures. Evaluation of motor and sensory function, autotomy, and histological parameters was carried out from 1 to 12 weeks after injury. We demonstrate that NGF cotreatment decreased the occurance of autotomy, suggesting a reduction of neuropathic pain, and improved the performance in motor and sensory tests. In addition, the number of regenerating motoneurons was significantly increased after NGF administration. GDNF increased the speed of sensory recovery, but also markedly increased autotomy, indicating an increased degree of neuropathic pain. aFGF did not alter the outcome of the motor or sensory tests. Fibrin sealant could easily be used in conjunction with sutures to deliver neurotrophic substances locally to the damaged nerve and to enhance recovery of nerve function. \u00a9 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

A new procedure-the \"mesh-and-\" (MAG) technique-has been developed by our group to seal the suture line with an absorbable mesh and fibrin glue. The results of preliminary studies to assess the efficacy of this technique using in vitro and in vivo experimental models and its use in clinical situations are reported here. The efficacy of conventional fibrin glue, simple glue spray, MAG, and MAG plus fibrin glue spray was estimated in vitro by measuring the leakage of water through a 1-cm suture line on ePTFE dural substitute. The burst pressures were 4.3 +/- 1.2 cm H<inf>2</inf>O, 64.4 +/- 21.4 cm H<inf>2</inf>O, 142.7 +/- 22.2 cm H<inf>2</inf>O, and 406.1 +/- 29.7 cm H<inf>2</inf>O, respectively, for the different sealing methods and 2.8 +/- 0.4 cm H<inf>2</inf>O for nonsealed controls. Although MAG alone was sufficient to seal a small dural defect, the seal formed when MAG was combined with the glue spray method was sufficiently strong to withstand arterial pressure (300 mm Hg). The type and incidence of long-term pathologic changes associated with MAG were assessed using a murine craniotomy model. Within 2 months of implantation, mesh and fibrin glue was transformed into connective tissue that adhered firmly to the surrounding tissues. These results indicate that MAG will be effective in clinical situations. Given that the seals can withstand arterial pressure, the MAG plus glue spray technique could potentially be used to seal other incisions such as the arachnoid membrane after spinal surgery or the suture line of an arteriotomy in carotid endarterectomy.",

This occurs particularly in the case of reoperation in presence of scar involving the dural sac, that increases the risk of laceration. The aim of this paper is to asses the usefulness of a new sealing and haemostatic material--TachoComb in a watertight closure of the dural sac during spinal operation. We compared the frequency of complications related to closing of the dural sac in patients operated before and after introduction of TachoComb. The results indicate that the rate of liquorrhoea and infections is lower in the postoperative period with addition of TachoComb.

We investigated the effect of simvastatin on the growth of malignant gliomas in vitro, semi-in vivo, and in vivo. An in-vitro MTT assay revealed that human malignant glioma cell lines: U-251MG, U-373MG, and U-87MG, and rat malignant glioma cell line C6 were well inhibited in growth in a dose-dependent fashion. An anchorage-independent growth assay showed that the number of colonies (more than 100 microM in size) of human (U-373MG) and rat malignant gliomas (C6) was markedly reduced in a dose-dependent fashion. A flow cytometry analysis revealed that simvastatin treatment led U-251MG cells to accumulate in sub G0-G1. Immunostaining by TUNEL method showed that most glioma cells treated by 10 microM simvastatin had nuclear immunostaining, suggesting apoptotic changes of the treated cells. The human umbilical vein endothelial cells and human lung fibroblasts were inhibited in growth by no more than 20% of controls even with a high dose (10 microM) of simvastatin. In the semi-in vivo model, using newborn rat brain slice cultures, the rhodamine-labeled glioma cells were abolished after 7 days of local simvastatin treatment with fibrin glue probably suggesting that simvastatin led the cells to apoptosis. In rat models using subcutaneously inoculated C6, the local application of simvastatin combined with fibrin glue (spray method) was quite effective in inhibiting the growth of the tumor. These data suggest that simvastatin may be a novel anti-glioma drug, and the local application of simvastatin combined with fibrin glue (by spray method) may be a crucial new clinical strategy against glioma growth.",

    "has_full_text": "no",
    "abstract": "Background: Fibrin sealants (FS) are frequently used in trauma surgery. Typically, they contain aprotinin (APO), a natural fibrinolysis inhibitor, to prevent premature clot degradation. Tranexamic acid (tAMCA), a synthetic fibrinolysis inhibitor, has been discussed as substitute for APO. Several studies have indicated that tAMCA may induce convulsions when applied to the central nervous system. In the present study, we elucidate whether tAMCA retains its convulsive nature when incorporated into an FS. Material and Methods: A laminectomy at T<inf>13</inf> was carried out in male anesthetized rats (n = 25). FS containing either APO or different concentrations of tAMCA (0.5, 5, 47.5 mg/ml) was applied to the pial surface of the lumbar spinal cord. One group of rats (control; n = 4) underwent laminectomy only. The response to noxious stimulation of the hind paw was assessed 5 min after application using a semiquantitative score. Results: Application of FS containing 5 or 47.5 mg/ml tAMCA resulted in severe hind limb (HL) convulsions leading to generalized convulsions in the tAMCA-47.5 group. In this group all animals died, while four of six survived in the tAMCA-5 group. No convulsions were noted in the APO and the tAMCA-0.5 groups, and all animals survived. All surviving animals showed normal HL motor function. Conclusions: tAMCA is able to induce convulsions when incorporated into an FS. Thus, use of FS containing tAMCA within or in vicinity of the central nervous system may pose a substantial risk for the patient.",

It is thin and elastic enough to allow microelectrode to pass through without any damage, using full visual control to target the electrode to the desirable recording site. This implant has proved crucial for maintaining the cortex in a good physiological condition and for preserving its optical characteristics that are necessary for optical imaging. We describe the details of the surgical implantation of the silicone dural substitute, the maintenance of the exposed cortex over long periods of time, the cortical reaction to this implant and its possible clinical implications in humans, and the rehabilitation procedure in monkeys.

    "abstract": "Background. Fibrin sealants (FS) derived from human plasma are frequently used in neurosurgery. In order to increase clot stability, FS typically contain aprotinin, a natural fibrinolysis inhibitor. Recently, synthetic fibrinolysis inhibitors such as tranexamic acid (tAMCA) have been considered as substitutes for aprotinin. However, tAMCA has been shown to cause epileptic seizures. We wanted to study whether tAMCA retains its convulsive action if incorporated into a FS. Method. FS containing aprotinin or different concentrations of tAMCA (0.5-47.5 mg/ml) were applied to the pial surface of the cortex of anaesthetized rats. The response of the animals was evaluated using electroencephalography and by monitoring the clinical behaviour during and after recovery from anaesthesia. Findings. FS containing tAMCA caused paroxysmal brain activity which was associated with distinct convulsive behaviours. The degree of these seizures increased with increasing concentration of tAMCA. Thus, FS containing 47.5 mg/ml tAMCA evoked generalized seizures in all tested rats (n = 6) while the lowest concentration of tAMCA (0.5 mg/ml) only evoked brief episodes of jerk-correlated convulsive potentials in 1 of 6 rats. In contrast, FS containing aprotinin did not evoke any paroxysmal activity. Interpretation. Tranexamic acid retains its convulsive action within FS. Thus, use of FS containing tAMCA for surgery within or close to the CNS may pose a substantial risk to the patient.",

The first case, a 56-year-old female complained of headache with high fever 18 days after the MVD for right trigeminal neuralgia. The amount of cells in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) had so much increased that bacterial meningitis was suspected. However, there was no improvement after antibiotics therapy, so immune globulin was injected and the meningitis gradually improved. Eosinophilia remained in peripheral blood and the symptoms improved rapidly after the steroid therapy. Because of this, we suspected that meningitis was caused by an abnormal allergic reaction. The second case, a 30-year-old male complained of headache with mild fever 15 days after MVD for left hemifacial spasm. The amount of cells in CSF increased, so bacterial meningitis was suspected. Eosinophilia remained in peripheral blood and the steroid therapy proved very effective for the meningitis. Because of this, we suspected that meningitis was caused by an abnormal allergic reaction. We suspected that the two patients suffered from aseptic meningitis caused by allergic reaction, and the antigen for this abnormal allergic reaction was the foreign materials used for MVD. The materials were Dacron for prostesis, Goatex or Lyodula for dural plasty, fibrin glue for preventing CSF leakage. We ascertained that the abnormal allergic reaction was caused by human fibrinogen in the second case. It is important to be aware of such allergic reaction to fibrin glue in the post-operative stage after MVD.",

    "abstract": "Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine whether glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) delivered intraspinally via a fibrin glue (FG) enhanced regeneration of cut dorsal root (DR). Methods: FG containing GDNF was inserted into aspiration cavities in the lumbar enlargement of adult rats. The transected L5 DR stump was placed at the bottom of the cavity and sandwiched between the FG and the spinal cord. Regenerated DR axons were labeled with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) or with immunohistochemical methods for calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Results: Primary afferent axons labeled with HRP regenerated into the spinal cord, received GDNF, and made frequent arborization there. Some of these were myelinated axons that established synapses on intraspinal neuronal profiles. CGRP-immunoreactive DR axons extended into the motor neurons and formed prominent varicosities around their cell bodies. Only a few axons regenerated into the spinal cords given FG without GDNF. Conclusions: Our results indicate that GDNF enhances regeneration of DR into the adult rat spinal cord and that GDNF may be effectively supplied to the intraspinal injury site via FG. Because the regenerated axons establish synapses on intraspinal neurons, this therapeutic strategy has the potential to help to rebuild spinal reflex circuits interrupted by spinal cord injury.",

    "abstract": "The tissue adhesive property of fibrinogen was first described 60 years ago. However, it was not until the availability of concentrated plasma fibrinogen and bovine thrombin that the use of fibrin sealants in surgical practice became widespread. Today, fibrin sealants are used for tissue sealing across a range of surgical procedures, including cardiothoracic, gastrointestinal, neurosurgery, and vascular surgery. Tissue sealing with fibrin sealant reduces perioperative hemorrhage and controls blood loss from cut surfaces of tissues that are difficult to suture. The use of fibrin sealants can also reduce perioperative and postoperative complications by reducing fluid leakage, air leakage, and by preventing fistulae formation. Fibrin sealants have a unique physiologic action, and the resulting fibrin clot is fully degraded by the body's natural wound healing process. The range of surgeries and types of procedure that incorporate the use of fibrin sealants in tissue sealing is expanding. As commercially prepared fibrin sealants become more widely available, the number of patients and surgeons benefiting from improved surgical outcomes is also set to increase. This article reviews the areas of surgery within which fibrin sealants are currently used to assist tissue sealing and highlights the improved surgical outcomes, such as reduced blood loss, operative time, and postoperative complications. \u00a9 2001 Experta Medica, Inc.

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The effectiveness of a strong, pressure-tight method for fibrin sealant application was experimentally and clinically evaluated, using expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) surgical membranes. METHODS: Two application methods were examined in two groups. For Group 1, 1 ml each of Solutions A and B was simply sprayed over the surface (spray method). For Group 2, a small amount of Solution A was rubbed into the sutured site and then Solutions A and B were sprayed over the surface (rubbing method). In the experimental study, a moment pressure elevation test and a continuous stepwise pressure elevation test were performed for both groups. The clinical study was conducted using 350 patients undergoing craniotomies. The ePTFE surgical membrane was used for 180 patients but not the other 170 patients. RESULTS: In the experimental study, the bursting pressures were 51.4 +/- 13.0 cm H<inf>2</inf>O for Group 1 and 129 +/- 35.0 cm H<inf>2</inf>O for Group 2 in the moment pressure elevation test and 27.0 +/- 6.7 cm H<inf>2</inf>O and 100 +/- 31.9 cm H<inf>2</inf>O, respectively, in the continuous stepwise pressure elevation test. The sealing effect was significantly greater for Group 2 than for Group 1 in both tests (P < 0.001). In the clinical study using ePTFE surgical membranes, the rubbing method significantly reduced the incidence of postoperative cerebrospinal fluid leakage (1.4%), compared with the spray method (18.3%), when external decompression was not concomitantly used (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The sealing effect of fibrin sealant on cerebrospinal fluid leakage was significantly greater with the rubbing method than with the spray method. The strong sealing effect obtained with the rubbing method is thought to result from firm linkage between the ePTFE surgical membrane and the fibrin sealant and also from fibrin being formed even in needle holes and spaces in the sutured site.",

The authors review the results of using resorbable vicryl patches, gelatin foam, and fibrin glue for sellar reconstruction. Methods. A review was conducted of 376 consecutive patients who underwent surgery for pituitary adenomas, cysts, or subdiaphragmatic craniopharyngiomas in the sella turcica that the senior author (R.W.S.) had performed or directly supervised over the last 10 years. The sellar reconstruction was performed with a commercially available, synthetic absorbable patch composed of polyglactin 910/poly-p-dioxanone, gelatin foam, and fibrin glue. The patch is essentially resorbed in 2 to 3 months and replaced by fibrous collagen tissue. There were 117 small, 112 medium-sized, and 147 large lesions. The overall nonendocrine postoperative morbidity rate was 2.8%, and included visual deterioration, meningitis, secondary epistaxis, nasal septum complication, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage. Two patients with macroadenomas needed reoperation for persistent CSF leakage, which comprised 0.5% of the whole series or 0.8% of the 259 patients with medium-sized or large lesions. There was no mortality and no morbidity related to the implanted material, and in particular no delayed empty sella syndrome. Conclusions. Closure of the sella turcica with a synthetic absorbable vicryl patch, gelatin foam, and fibrin glue after transsphenoidal surgery is safe and very effective in preventing postoperative CSF fistulas. The use of this technique obviates the need for a second surgical incision and shortens the operating time. Because of the progressive resorption of the substitute material, the interpretation of postoperative magnetic resonance studies was not significantly hindered.",

The response of the rats was evaluated based on neurological and behavioral observations. Additionally, motor function was scored in the rats that had received FS. RESULTS: Application of either 10 mg/ml t-AMCA or FS containing t-AMCA caused severe hind limb spasms that developed into spontaneous generalized convulsions. Two of the three rats that had received FS containing t-AMCA died of respiratory failure. In contrast, application of vehicle or FS containing aprotinin did not cause any abnormal conditions of the animals.

Our goal was to improve the treatment of these cysts with microsurgical cyst fenestration and imbrication, while minimizing functional damage to neural tissues. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records for eight adult patients with large (2-3-cm) sacral perineural cysts who were treated at the University of California, San Francisco, between October 1992 and April 1999. All patients presented with radicular pain that was refractory to medical treatment. Three patients also reported urinary incontinence. We performed sacral laminectomies with microsurgical cyst fenestration and cyst imbrication for all patients, using intraoperative electromyography to minimize damage to the sacral nerve roots. For seven patients, we reinforced the closures with epidural fat or muscle grafts and fibrin glue application. For five patients with cysts that communicated with the subarachnoid space in computed tomographic myelograms, we placed lumbar drains for cerebrospinal fluid diversion for several days postoperatively. We assessed outcomes, using telephone questionnaires and periodic postoperative physical examinations, 3 to 73 months after surgery. RESULTS: After surgery, radicular pain improved markedly for four patients and moderately for three patients; one patient with initial improvement experienced pain recurrence 9 months later. Bladder control improved markedly for two of the three patients with bladder dysfunction. There were no cerebrospinal fluid leaks and no new postoperative neurological deficits.

Both the fibrin glue and inflammation had disappeared at 2 months, but the glue had induced mild inflammation in the adventitia. Biobond caused chronic inflammation, necrosis of the media, and thickening of the arterial wall due to fibrosis in both the media and adventitia. Bemsheet produced chronic inflammation, progressive fibrosis, and granuloma. Connective tissue increased in the adventitia, but no major changes were observed in the media. The Bemsheet fibers remained unchanged, and adhered to the arterial wall.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Preoperative embolization expands the spectrum of meningioma that can be operated on safely. Our goal was to achieve the distalmost loading of the vascular bed and confluent tumor necrosis with a fibrin glue preparation in the preoperative embolization of meningiomas. METHODS: Between 1992 and 1997, 80 patients with a meningioma had diagnostic angiography with a standard transfemoral Seldinger technique, performed with a 6F guiding catheter and digital subtraction angiography. Preoperative embolization was carried out in the same session with an additional microcatheter system. Fibrin glue was the only component used. In all cases, CT was performed immediately after embolization; in nine patients, MR imaging was also performed. RESULTS: Angiography verified the elimination of tumor blush in all patients. The high-density areas seen on postembolization CT scans, caused by the fibrin glue dispersed in the embolized supply area, were found to be necrotic at surgery and were easily removed by suction. Two (2.5%) of the 80 patients had complications associated with embolization that resulted in neurologic deficits. CONCLUSION: The most effective preoperative embolization of tumors requires a distalmost loading of the vascular bed. Fibrin glue, which is easy to use and safe to handle, causes confluent tumor necrosis within the injected vascular territory.",

Trimming of the nerve ends before repair is often necessary to achieve cut nerve end planes. In this technical report, we describe a technique for stabilization and accurate trimming of nerve ends using fibrin glue. SURGICAL TECHNIQUE: The nerve ends of divided peripheral nerves are coated with fibrin glue and subsequently trimmed using a razor blade before repair. RESULTS: When fibrin glue is applied, a firm layer with a rubbery consistency is formed around the nerve. This layer stabilizes the nerve ends during trimming, and a clear-cut plane of the nerve can be achieved. Moreover, the fibrin glue stabilizes the nerve ends during manipulations caused by suturing of the nerve. CONCLUSION: The technique results in easier handling of the nerve during trimming and manipulation, minimal tissue damage to the nerve, and a clear-cut plane of the nerve.",

    "has_full_text": "no",
    "abstract": "Objective: Persistent cerebrospinal fluid leaks in the human population are rarely found in otherwise healthy individuals, but occur in patients with comorbid illnesses. These leaks are frequently resistant to dural suturing or closure of the defect site with connective tissue, cartilage, or plastic materials. In this study, fibrin sealant (ViGuard Fibrin Sealant was used to adhere muscle grafts to surgically created dural defects to close cerebrospinal fluid leaks in chinchillas. Histologic evaluation of the defect sites were conducted to assess healing and tissue response in the test and control groups. Method: In 20 chinchillas, after a skin incision, a 6 mm X 6 mm window was created in the right superior bulla exposing the underlying bony tegmen. Using a microcutting burr, a 3 mm X 3 mm area of tegmen was drilled out and the exposed dura was resected to create a large cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak. In the control group (n = 10), a small muscle graft from the surrounding tissue was placed into the defect site. In the test group (n = 10), the muscle graft was glued into the defect with ViGuard Fibrin Sealant. Bulla and skin were then closed. All animals were killed at 3 weeks into the experiment, and tissue was harvested for histologic examination. Setting: The Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery Research Laboratory, University of Illinois, Chicago. Results: Three weeks after surgery in the test group the tegmen defects were found to be closed by bone or connective tissue or both. Meninges had regrown, and the underlying brain appeared histologically normal. There was no evidence of CSF leak, toxicity, infection or other deleterious tissue reactions. In the control group, again the meningeal and bony tegmen defects were seen to be closed by connective tissue or bone or both. Brain tissues appeared histologically normal. There was no evidence of CSF leak, toxicity, or other deleterious tissue reactions. One animal of the test group died of unknown causes. On autopsy, no signs of meningitis or encephalitis could be detected and the cause of death was unapparent. Conclusion: Fibrin Sealant, made from pooled donor blood and treated with viral elimination procedures, was found in combination with muscle grafts to securely close induced CSF leaks in the chinchilla model. Inflammation, infection, or toxic reactions were not observed. We believe that ViGuard Fibrin Sealant has stronger bonding power compared with available autologous fibrin tissue adhesives.",

Thrombin fluid is then slowly applied to the wet mesh, forming a large fibrin membrane reinforced by the mesh over the suture line. Only one of 33 patients in whom this technique was used had CSF leakage, whereas 12 of 59 patients in whom a dural defect was closed with ePTFE alone showed postoperative subcutaneous CSF collection (p < 0.05). Our clinical experiences clearly show the efficacy of the mesh-and-glue technique to prevent CSF leakage after artificial dural substitution. Mesh and glue can provide an adequate repair for small dural defect. The mesh-and-glue technique may also be used for arachnoid sealing in spinal surgery.",

    "abstract": "Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) as a dural substitute is sometimes associated with leakage of cerebrospinal fluid through the suture line. We have developed a new technique to seal the suture line with an absorbable mesh and fibrin glue. It is named as the mesh-and-glue technique. In this paper, the basic background of the efficacy of this technique was examined using in vitro and in vivo experimental models. The sealing effect was estimated on water leakage through 1cm of suture line on the ePTFE sutured with 4 - 0 braided nylon at intervals of 2mm. The burst pressure of the non-sealed, conventional fibrin glue, simple glue spray, mesh-and-glue, and mesh-and-glue combined with spray was 2.8+/-0.4, 4.3+/-1.2, 64.4 +/-21.4, 142.7+/-22.2 and 406.1+/-29.7cm H<inf>2</inf>O respectively. It was worth noting that mesh-and-glue combined with the spray method can tolerate even arterial pressure. It was also observed that mesh-and-glue can seal a small dural defect. Long-term pathological changes of the mesh-and-glue was examined in a murine craniotomy model. Implanted mesh and fibrin glue was gradually transformed into a tight connective tissue firmly adhering to the surrounding structure within two months. These experimental results well support the clinical efficacy of the mesh-and-glue technique. This technique can also be applied to seal the arachnoid membrane after spinal surgery or to seal the suture line of arteriotomy in carotid endoarterectomy.",

When drawing blood, 14 patients whose hemoglobin level was below 13 g/dl (body weight < 70kg) or 14g/dl (body weight > 70kg) received subcutaneous recombinant human erythropoietin injection (s.c.) to facilitate erythropoiesis, according to the internal standard protocol. Hemoglobin levels of all the patients recovered to more than 10g/dl by the time they were admitted to the hospital, which value would not interfere with general neurosurgical procedures. The injection of erythropoietin did not cause any side effects. Autologous blood transfusion was performed in 43 patients but, in 3 patients, additional homologous transfusion was required because of excessive bleeding. Except in cases with meningioma, postoperative hemoglobin values were identical with preoperative values, indicating that autologous blood transfusion was enough to replace intraoperative blood loss. Autologous fibrin glue was applied in 74 patients. In 70 cases including 55 with skull base surgery, the glue was applied to ensure dural closure. The incidence of cerebrospinal fluid leakage was 16.4% (5 patients) in skull base surgery. This incidence was identical to or less than that in previous reports. The glue was also effective in transposing and fixing offending vessels in 4 cases which received microvascular decompression. As a conclusion, procedures for autologous blood preservation and transfusion were safely performed in neurosurgical cases.

We used this method in 25 patients with brachial plexus injury and 29 patients with injuries to the sciatic nerve. Results were analyzed according to the individual nerve elements and were available for 32 elements of the brachial plexus and for 19 tibial and 19 peroneal divisions of the sciatic nerve. We defined useful functional recovery according to the priorities in repair of the brachial plexus and sciatic nerve with lower limits M3 for relevant muscles and functions and S2 for sensory function. Results were especially favourable for the brachial plexus with a total rate of recovery 84% and for tibial division with the same total rate of recovery. On the basis of the results obtained we were able to conclude that the results of the modified cable grafting were at least similar to those of interfascicular nerve grafting and that this method could be useful for repair of large polyfascicular nerve trunks.

The burst pressure for a one-step increase in pressure was 43.3 cm H<inf>2</inf>O when the external spray method was used, and 61.0 cm H<inf>2</inf>O when the sandwich method was used. The burst pressure for stepwise increases in pressure was 20 cm H<inf>2</inf>O when the external spray method was used, and 30 cm H<inf>2</inf>O when the sandwich method was used. CSF leakage from dura mater repaired with ePTFE surgical membrane is more frequent and the sealing effect of fibrin glue is less effective when compared with cadaveric dural grafts.

The changes in the neuronal and glial elements and also the numbers of inflammatory and endothelial cells in the vicinity of implanted fibrin glue pellets were compared with those of gelfilm pellets. The results demonstrated that topical application of fibrin glue to the brain causes significantly enhanced local accumulation of mononuclear cells and promoted angiogenesis close to the wound while not affecting the neuronal and glial elements.

The mean age was 41.8 years (range: 6-72). The main clinical presentation was haemorrhage in 65 patients (56.5%), seizures in 31 patients (27.0%), neurological deficit in 7 patients (6.1%) and hydrocephalus in 2 patients (1.7%); in 10 patients (8.7%) the AVM was an incidental finding. Treatment consisted of surgery, radiosurgery with the gamma knife and embolization. Embolization was mostly used to reduce the size of an AVM before surgery or radiosurgery. Results. Out of 115 patients 5 were referred for a treatment advice only and treatment was performed elsewhere. Of the remaining 110 patients 84 (76.4%) were treated and 26 (213.6%) were not treated for various reasons. Of the 84 treated patients 17 (20.2%) had surgery only, 17 (20.2%) had radiosurgery only, and 12 (14.3%) were treated with embolization only.

Because autologous transplantation of human Schwann cells (SCs) is a potential strategy for CNS repair, we evaluated the ability of these two molecular agents to induce CST regeneration into human SC grafts placed to span a midthoracic spinal cord transection in the adult nude rat, a xenograft tolerant strain. IN-1 or control (HRP) antibodies were delivered to the injury/graft region by encapsulated hybridoma cells ('IN-1 ravioli') or daily infusion of hybridoma culture supernatant; aFGF-fibrin glue was placed in the same region in other animals. Anterograde tracing from the motor cortex using the dextran amine tracers, Fluororuby (FR) and biotinylated dextran amine (BDA), was performed. Thirty-five days after grafting, the CST response was evaluated qualitatively by looking for regenerated CST fibers in or beyond grafts and quantitatively by constructing camera lucida composites to determine the sprouting index (SI), the position of the maximum termination density (MTD) rostral to the GFAP-defined host/graft interface, and the longitudinal spread (LS) of bulbous end terminals. The latter two measures provided information about axonal die-back. In control animals (graft only), the CST did not enter the SC graft and underwent axonal die-back [SI = 1.4 +/- 0.1, MTD = 2.0 +/- 0.2, LS = 1.3 +/- 0.3, (n = 3)]. Results of IN-1 delivery from ravioli did not differ from controls, but injections of IN-1-containing supernatant resulted in a significant degree of sprouting but did not prevent axonal die-back [SI = 1.9 +/- 0.1, MTD = 1.5 0.2, LS = 1.1 +/- 0.1, (n = 7)] and traced fibers did not enter grafts. Acidic FGF dramatically reduced axonal die-back and caused sprouting [SI = 2.0 +/- 0.1 (n = 5), MTD = 0.5 +/- 0.04 (n = 6), LS = 0.4 +/- 0.1 (n = 6)]. Some traced fibers entered SC grafts and in 2/6 cases entered the distal interface. We conclude that 1) human SC grafts alone do not support the regeneration of injured CST fibers and do not prevent die-back, 2) grafts plus IN-1 antibody-containing supernatant support some sprouting but die-back continues, and 3) grafts plus aFGF-fibrin glue support regeneration of some fibers into the grafts and reduce die-back.",

While the majority of leaks induced after head trauma will seal without intervention, spontaneous or surgically-induced leaks often require operative repair. Many modifications on standard surgical technique are available for repair of CSF fistulae, but none assures adequate closure. We have studied the efficacy of a novel fibrin-based composite tissue adhesive (CTA) for closure of experimentally-induced CSF leaks in rats. Fistulae were created in two groups of animals. Two weeks after creation of the leaks, the animals were sacrificed and analyzed for persistence of leak. A 58% leakage rate was noted in the control group (n = 12), and no leaks were noted in the experimental group closed after application of CTA to the surgical defect followed by skin closure (n = 11). Comparing the control group to the experimental group, results were statistically significant (p = 0.015). These data suggest that CTA may be effective as an adjunct for the closure of CSF fistulae.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To assess CT-guided injection of fibrin glue for the management of lumbosacral cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks. METHODS: Six consecutive patients with postoperative CSF leaks were treated after CSF aspiration under CT guidance. A solution of cryoprecipitate was simultaneously injected with a 10% calcium chloride solution containing 2000 units of thrombin per milliliter. In one patient, 0.5 mL of iopamidol was added to the calcium chloride/thrombin mixture before injection. Placement of the fibrin glue aggregate was confirmed by CT imaging. To deter mine outcomes we reviewed the patients' records, postprocedure imaging studies, and physical findings, and we interviewed the patients directly. RESULTS: In three patients with postoperative CSF leaks, symptoms resolved after treatment. Despite imaging evidence of successful plug deployment, two other patients still had severe symptoms, and they underwent surgery after 2 and 18 hours, respectively. One patient had a continued CSF leak and a headache after 12 hours; follow-up surgery repaired an unsuspected dural tear just distal to the site of original surgery underneath the lamina and not covered by the fibrin glue. After one of the successful procedures, the patient had a fever and a headache, probably because of aseptic meningitis, which resolved after 2 days. CONCLUSION: Percutaneous CT-guided placement of fibrin glue may provide nonsurgical treatment for postoperative CSF leaks, potentially avoiding a major and technically difficult surgical procedure.",

However, to further improve regenerative possibilities, the problems of inconstant bony fusion and cyst formations within the junctions must be resolved. Modifying the method of de Medinaceli on the rat thoracic spine, we attempted several fixation devices to achieve better interspinal fixation after spondylectomy and transection, including transpedicular miniscrews, wiring of the transverse processes, and wiring of the posterior spinal processes. A dynamic model, based on retracting and compressing the cut ends of the spinal cord by means of adjustable fixation devices to allow swelling and shrinking of the stumps was also attempted to better compensate pathophysiologic changes of the transected cord. The best regeneration, as indicated by regrowth of 5-HT fibers below the level of transection, was obtained following application of fibrin glue and compressive wiring of posterior spinal processes. In this group, the distance between proximal and distal GFAP-rich spinal cord tissue (gap consisting of GFAP-poor components such as cysts, phagocytic cells, and scar tissue) of the two spinal cord stumps was also the shortest. With better approximation, the numbers of regenerated 5-HT fibers improved remarkably, suggesting that this descending fiber system is able to bridge the transection under these conditions.",

Continuing our research further, we have now investigated the biocompatibility of cranioplasty in rats. Two sets of Wistar rat (250-300 g) underwent a small craniectomy of the parietal bone, about 4 x 5 mm in size, without causing damage to the dura mater. The Ceratite in the form of granules, 0.3-0.6 mm in diameter, was then applied to the bone defect with Beriplast P. Postoperatively, at 3 and at 12 months, the results in each rat set, consisting of 6 rats each, were respectively evaluated. To accomplish this, 10 mum thick sections from each set were prepared and stained with hematoxylin and eosin and examined under light microscopy. Results revealed that at 3 months postoperatively, there were signs that an excellent cranioplastic repair was in progress, but newly formed bone had not yet to be seen among the Ceratite granules. However, at 12 months postoperatively, the repair appeared to be progressing well, for regenerated bone was observed amongst the Ceratite granules. Cranioplasties using Ceratite granules and Beriplast P have been performed for 22 neurosurgical patients, including one with a posterior fossa bone defect, and neither an infection nor local abnormal granulation were noted during the postoperative follow-up. These findings suggest that composite ceramics possess an excellent biocompatibility, and that the combined usage of composite granular ceramics and fibrin glue is both useful and safe fur cranioplasties.",

This study was designed to examine whether fibrin glue is useful as a vehicle for sustained release of intraoperative local chemotherapy with nitrosourea (ACNU). METHODS: The growth-inhibiting activity of ACNU on C6 glioma cells and ACNU released into 5-mL supernatant saline from fibrin glue containing 5 mg/mL (10 mg) of ACNU was measured in vitro. C6 tumor inoculated in rat brains was covered with fibrin glue containing either 2 mg/mL or 5 mg/mL of ACNU for 5 days, and the histologic changes were examined. RESULTS: ACNU inhibited the growth of C6 glioma cells in a dose-dependent manner, and the drug concentration required for 50% inhibition of cell growth (IC<inf>50</inf>) was about 4 mug/mL with 1 hour of treatment. Although about 50% of all ACNU included in the fibrin glue was released in the first hour, an effective concentration over the value of IC<inf>50</inf> was sustained even after 12 hours. A histologic examination showed tumor cells damaged within a depth of about 2- 3 mm from the tumor surface covered with fibrin glue containing ACNU. CONCLUSIONS: Fibrin glue may be useful as a vehicle for sustained-release chemotherapy, and intraoperative local chemotherapy with fibrin glue containing anticancer agents such as nitrosourea may be helpful in the local control of malignant gliomas.",

CT scan showed marked dilatation of the lateral and third ventricles and enlarged sphenoid sinus of water density, extending to the lateral wall of the left orbit and to the left pterygoid fossa. Immediately after the onset of CSF rhinorrhea, ventricular drainage was performed, but the rhinorrhea persisted. Ventriculography revealed predominant flow of the contrast medium into the left temporal horn and abnormal collection in the sphenoid sinus. Coronal CT scan did not show any focal bony defect, but a thin layer was seen in the base of the left middle fossa. Exploration of the skull base in the left middle fossa was performed through a left frontotemporal craniotomy. An irregular bony defect measuring 7 x 12 mm was then found in the anterolateral floor of the middle fossa and the dura was also perforated there. Brain tissue including the temporal horn protruded through the bony defect into the sphenoid sinus. After excision of the herniated brain tissue, repair was accomplished by packing muscle into the bony defect and covering the dural defect with fat reinforced by coating with fibrin glue. Postoperatively, the CSF rhinorrhea has stopped and the edema of her face has disappeared. We discuss the etiology of this unusual spontaneous CSF leakage through the middle fossa and the abnormally enlarged sphenoid sinus.",

This study describes processes of absorption of fibrin clot used on the dura mater. Six specimens of fibrin clot were obtained by second surgery 11 up to 285 days after the first surgery. Approximately 2 weeks after the surgery, a membranous fibrin clot was partially dissolved and absorbed by densely infiltrating inflammatory cells. The cells were predominantly neutrophils, and in part macrophages. A specimen pulled apart from the autologous dura mater 4 weeks after the surgery was replaced with fibrous connective tissue composed with loose collagen fiber networks. Lymphocytes migrated in place of phagocytes. Infiltration and proliferation of fibroblasts were seen and endothelial cells formed small vessels. In part, however, fibrin clot remained. The vascular connection was observed between the granuloma and the dura mater. After 10 months, fibrin clot was replaced with mature granuloma composed of collagenous connective tissue with scarce eosinophil migration. On the other hand, fibrin glue sprayed on a processed human dura mater was hardly resolved compared to that on autologous dura and remained as a fragile membranous clot after 1 weeks or later. It was speculated that a clot resolution preceding to a granuloma formation may induce delayed cerebrospinal fluid leakage, especially on the non vascularized artificial dura mater.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes a surgical technique that modifies the conventional suboccipital craniectomy for cerebellopontine angle lesions. Briefly, a patient is first placed in a lateral park bench position, after which a linear longitudinal skin incision approximately, 1 cm posterior to the mastoid process is made while preserving the lesser occipital nerve. Muscle dissection is then carried out as each anatomical layer is reached. Next, the sternomastoid is detached from the cranium and turned out anteroinferiorly, and the splenium capitis is reflected posteroinferiorly in the same manner. On reaching the deep layer, the longissimus capitis, the posterior belly of digastric muscle, the superior oblique and the major rectus capitis are identified and reflected in the direction of their origins. A burr hole is then made adjacent to the asterion, after which the craniectomy is pursued, a using a hand held rongeur and an air drill while the posterior one third of the sigmoid sinus is exposed. Removed bone chips are kept sterile during the course of the surgery. The dura is incised in semicoronal shape, based on the contour of the sigmoid sinus. The dural flap is fixed by firm suturing to the connective tissue of the mastoid process. Simultaneously, this enables a part of the sigmoid sinus to be turned out anteriorly. Opening of the cisterna magna and aspiration of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) immediately reduces the tension of the cerebellar hemisphere. The craniectomy enables the offering of an optimally short and direct operative field to the cerebellopontine angle, with intradural procedures even possible without a brain retractor. After the intradural procedures are completed, cranioplasty is performed using the removed bone chips mixed with a spray of fibrin glue, after which the muscles are repositioned to their original sites by suturing. We have concluded that this surgical technique has enabled a reduction in pressure that a brain retractor can inflict on the cerebellum and the elimination of postoperative CSF leakage.",

The interstitial chemotherapy with sustained release of anticancer drugs has been widely investigated to overcome these problems. The Mitomycin C (MMC)-contained fibrin glue might be a promising candidate for use in local chemotherapy of malignant brain tumors. We investigated pharmacokinetics of the MMC-contained fibrin clot in vitro, activity of the MMC for the cultured glioma cell line, and its effect on the normal mouse brain. The MMC concentration in saline was measured up to 96 hours after the placement of fibrin glue into 5, 10 and 15 ml of saline. Then we periodically replaced the saline to keep the concentration difference of the MMC between the saline and the fibrin clot and evaluated the dissolution of the MMC for 288 hours. The potency of the MMC to suppress the rat glioma cell line was measured after being dissolved from the MMC-contained fibrin clot. The effects of the MMC-contained fibrin clot were histologically evaluated. The MMC-contained fibrin glue, the MMC solution and the fibrin glue were separately injected into the mouse brains. Mice were sacrificed 24, 72, 168 and 336 hours after the injection and brains were examined with photomicroscopy. The MMC was released into the saline rapidly within 24 hours then gradually released until 96 hours had elapsed. Total amounts of the dissolved MMC were proportional to the amounts in the saline. When the saline was replaced every 48 hours, twice as much the MMC was released compared with the amount when it was not replaced. Potency of the MMC did not change after dissolution from the fibrin clot. The injection of the MMC-contained fibrin glue caused necrosis in a limited area and the inflammatory reaction persisted for more than 168 hours. The injection of the MMC solution resulted in wider necrosis and the inflammatory reaction subsided earlier. The fibrin clot did not affect the mouse brain. It is concluded that the fibrin clot releases the active MMC in a sustained fashion and has little adverse effect on the mouse brain. The MMC-contained fibrin glue might be valuable in the treatment of patients with malignant brain tumors.",

It has become used frequently in neurosurgical procedures, in particular in the closure of the dura mata to prevent cerebrospinal fluid leakage. This report evaluates sealing effects of the fibrin glue on cerebrospinal fluid leakage through the dura. (1) Three manipulations for application of fibrin glue were used; i.e., layer, mixture and spray methods. These methods were compared to estimate their sealing effects on water leakage through a 1.2 mm pore in an artificial dura. The burst pressure was significantly higher when the spray method was used than when the other two methods were used. (2) Dural incision was made and then sutured at intervals of 2mm, 3mm, 4mm, 6mm, and 8mm. Fibrin glue was applied by a spray method on the sutured dura. The burst pressure of the fibrin plate was over 80cmH<inf>2</inf>O on every interval of dural suture. (3) Dural defects 2mm, 4mm, 6mm, and 8mm in diameter were made, and then spray of fibrin glue was used to shield the defects. The fibrin clot spreading to the inner and outer surfaces of the pore defect was plug-shaped. The fibrin plug tolerated water pressure over 200cmH<inf>2</inf>O, in every size of pore. In conclusion, the optimal method for using fibrin glue on the surface of the dura was a spray method. Fibrin plate/clot made by the spray method sealed the dural tear or pore so well that it sustained a water pressure of over 80cmH<inf>2</inf>O, which is far higher than normal pressure of the intracranial cerebrospinal fluid.",

The competence of human cryoprecipitate-thrombin (CPT) 'tissue glues' in providing a watertight seal for patched rat fascia and human cadaveric dural defects was assessed. A saline column was fabricated to allow for controlled pressure (up to 700 mm) to be applied over an open aperature containing the repaired defect. Variables of repair included time after repair, defect size, and mixing temperature. Results. Wide variations in the strength of different cryoprecipitate glues were found. Time allowed after repair did not significantly affect the repair strength. Cooling the components of the glue solution prior to mixing significantly increased repair strength. Similar results were found for different defect sizes. Conclusions. Under controlled in vitro conditions, integrity of fibrin glue repairs varied widely. This was not attributable to differences in solution fibrinogen concentration.

    "abstract": "One of the limitations of many bridging experiments in neural transplantation is that the CNS tissues cannot be sutured. Fibrin glue is a two-component system derived from whole blood which, when mixed, reproduces the final stage of blood coagulation and solidifies. Many experimental studies of humans and animals show that fibrin glue repair of peripheral nerves is almost equivalent to microsurgical sutures. In this study, we attempted to extend its use to CNS tissues and transplants. Two techniques were tried: (1) Bilateral parietal knife cuts were performed by stereotaxic technique in six rats. Fibrin glue was applied in the right-side cortical lesion. Immunohistochemistry using antisera to tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), laminin and neurofilament (NF) was essentially similar between the control and treatment groups. The immunoreactivity of each marker revealed no significant differences between the two groups on days 1, 7 and 30. There was no difference in terms of gliosis or microvascular proliferation. (2) Embryonic day 16 fetal locus coeruleus was grafted together with E16 cortex to the anterior chamber of sympathectomized eyes. In the six eyes of the glue treatment group, the parietal cortical piece and the locus coeruleus piece were joined together before grafting by immersing them in the solution of fibrin glue. In the eight eyes of the control group, pieces of parietal cortex and locus coeruleus were introduced individually and approximated by gently pressing the cornea. The sizes of double grafts showed no significant difference between groups during six weeks postgrafting. The immunohistochemical pictures using antisera against TH, GFAP and laminin were similar in both groups. Catecholaminergic fibers from the grafted locus coeruleus were found bridging over into the parietal cortical piece in both the control and treatment groups. There was no significant difference in TH-positive nerve fiber density between tissue glue-joined and control double intraocular grafts. In conclusion, fibrin glue can be used as an adhesive agent in CNS tissues without hampering the outgrowth of neurites or causing adverse tissue reactions in fetal or adult nervous tissues.",

    "abstract": "A new fibrin seal has recently been evaluated in terms of axonal regeneration; however morphological examination of the fibre composition of regenerated nerves may not necessarily provide functionally relevant information. This study therefore aims to evaluate the functional regenerated sensation, following peripheral nerve transection treated with fibrin seal. The sural nerve-innervated skin of the rat hindfoot served as the target organ. Previously published results from animals following transection and suture served as controls. Ten 3-month-old female Sprague-Dawley rats were used. The sciatic nerve was divided and rejoined with fibrin seal. The rats were allowed unrestricted movement directly after surgery and allowed to survive for 3 months. Our observations show that the functional results of regenerated polymodal nociceptors and low-threshold mecanoreceptors show no statistical difference well compared with microsuture. This strengthens the early positive morphological impression of this new product. Further prospective studies in man are anticipated.",

    "has_full_text": "no",
    "abstract": "Our objective was to study intratemporal anastomosis of the facial nerve in cats. Clinical, electrophysiological and histological results of the use of fibrin tissue adhesive, epineural suture and natural adhesion were compared. The 30 adult cats studied had undergone mastoidectomy exposure, and section of the facial nerve 1 cm before its exit from the stylomastoid foramen. Anastomosis was then undertaken, using epineural suture combined with stabilization through fibrinic tissue adhesive, and union of the stumps without stabilizing them. Each type of anastomosis was carried out in 10 animals. Clinical, electrophysiological and histological assessments of both the site of anastomosis and the ventral branch of the facial nerve followed the aforementioned procedures. By means of statistical analysis, the authors reached the following conclusions: 1) Considering the clinical assessment per se, both groups with fibrinic tissue adhesive and suture showed similar features and results, which in both cases were better than those following natural union. 2) Considering the electrophysiological results per se, the use of fibrin tissue adhesive was superior to any other method used. 3) Considering the histological examination per se, both groups with fibrin tissue adhesive and suture revealed similar features which were more favourable than those shown by natural union. 4) In the overall comparison of the various parameters in the three groups, the use of fibrin tissue adhesive achieved better results than any other method. Based on the results of this study, the authors conclude that the use of fibrin tissue adhesive has technical advantages, and that the results of this use outweigh those achieved with both epineural suture and natural union. The authors recommend this technique as the most beneficial to be resorted to, for intrapetrous anastomosis of the facial nerve.",

At ten weekly intervals, functional recovery, assessed by sciatic nerve stimulated evoked contraction of the flexor digitorum muscle, was quicker and more complete following nerve crush than following the anastomosis techniques which were not different from each other. Ten weeks following the surgery, the retrograde transport morphological technique indicated that the anastomosis techniques were not different from each other. The number of labeled tibial motoneurons (tube and suture groups) was significantly less than the crush group, but the glue group was intermediate. Thus, although having less extensive recovery following crush, the quicker and easier techniques of nerve repair, i.e., collagen tubes or fibrin glue, produced comparable anatomical and functional recovery as the more time-consuming, technically demanding microsurgical repair with fine sutures.",

In addition, there are occasions when it is virtually impossible to perform a suture repair because of limited exposure and/or very fine structures, such as are encountered in pediatric cases. These situations have continued to provide the impetus for evaluating alternative methods of nerve coaptation. Recently, the use of tissue glue has gained in popularity as a technique for sutureless nerve repairs. We decided to test the efficacy of fibrin glue repair versus microsuture coaptation in the rat sciatic model. The repair sites were assessed for tensile strength, by quantitative morphometry, and by electrophysiologic studies. Tensile strength findings revealed that at two, four, and eight weeks after surgery, there was no significant difference between the two repair techniques, although there was a trend toward a stronger hold in the microsuture repairs. Electrophysiologic recordings revealed that conventional microsuture repairs had significantly faster conduction velocities, larger area under the curve, and higher peak amplitudes. The onset and peak latencies were comparable, revealing that the axonal quality of at least a certain number of axons was similar electrically. Axonal counts both proximal and distal to the repair showed no significant difference, although there was an overall suggestion of superiority in the number of myelinated axons in the suture repair.",

To test the effect of fibrin glue on nerve regeneration without the confounding variables of distraction and/or movement of the anastomosis, nerve repairs were performed with and without fibrin glue on the intratemporal facial nerve of the rat. The location of the nerve transection was the same for control and experimental nerves, but on the experimental side the nerve was repaired with fibrin glue and on the control side of the nerve was reapproximated in the fallopian canal, without glue or sutures. Axon counts distal to the repair revealed no statistically significant difference between the two methods of repair.

Direct suturing, packing with muscle and fat grafts, and coverage with mucosal or muscle flaps have been effective in repairing most CSF leaks. Fibrin glue will improve the results of a CSF leak repair by providing better adhesion of the graft and improving the initial seal during healing. Experiments were performed on 39 rats to assess the effectiveness of fibrin glue in repairing experimentally produced CSF leaks. CSF leak was produced by creating defects at the cribriform plate. There were four experimental groups; 1. no treatment control; 2. fibrin adhesive alone; 3. muscle packing alone; 4. fibrin glue with muscle packing. The CSF leaks were evaluated 3 weeks after repairs. Persistent CSF leakage was noted in 89% of group 1, 55% of group 2, 33% of group 3, and 22% of group 4.

    "abstract": "Surgical repair of cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea requires the production of a seal able to resist cerebrospinal fluid pressure during the period of healing. Direct suturing, packing with muscle and fat grafts, and coverage with mucosal or muscle flaps have been effective in repairing most CSF leaks. Fibrin glue may enhance the results of a CSF leak repair by providing better adhesion of the graft and improving the initial seal during healing. A study was performed on 36 rats to assess the effectiveness of fibrin glue in repairing experimentally produced CSF leaks. CSF rhinorrhea was produced by creating a defect in the anterior cranila fossa through the region of the cribiform plate. There were four treatment groups: 1. no treatment control; 2. fibrin adhesive alone; 3. muscle packing alone; and 4. fibrin glue with muscle packing. The CSF leaks were evaluated 3 weeks after operation. Persistent CSF leakage was noted in 89% of group 1, 55% of group 2, 33% of group 3, and 22% of group 4. The reduced CSF leakage in the muscle plus fibrin glue group suggests that fibrin glue, by its adhesive sealing properties, enhances the results of muscle packing alone for the treatment of cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea.",

    "abstract": "The definitive stoppage of bleeding in large cerebral resection zones is often difficult due to possible petechial seeping haemorrhage. Evacuo-rebleeding can be reduced by the application of tissue adhesion with fibrinogen and thrombin together with oxycellulose or very thin strips of collagen viles. A further indication exists in the additional adhesion of dural seams or duraplasties not only supra-, but especially infratentorially and spinally. In extra-intracranial anastomosis operations, even the smallest bleeding from the side branches of the arteria temporalis superficialis can be avoided by applying tissue adhesion with fibrinogen and thrombin to the stem of the vascular muscles of the donor artery. This minimises the danger of a subdural haematoma in the anastomotic region. An electrical coagulation of these small side branches, directly next to the donor artery, should not be forced due to a possible thrombosis of the trunk. The seams can be limited to six to eight by thin application of tissue adhesions with fibrinogen and thrombin onto the actual vascular anastomosis, so that not only the danger of vascular obliteration caused by additional seams, but also the period of time of the intermitting clamping of the cerebral recipient vessel can be reduced. Further indications are mentioned.",

We developed a new technique involving dural moisturizing with fibrin glue coating that facilitates primary dural closure.\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: We used this technique in 12 adults who underwent the lateral suboccipital approach for 5 hemifacial spasms, 3 trigeminal neuralgias, 2 cerebellopontine meningiomas, 1 vestibular schwannoma, and 1 vertebral artery aneurysm. Fibrin glue was sprayed on the outer surface before opening the dura, and additionally sprayed on the inner surface of the reflected dural flap after opening the dura. After the intradural procedures the dura was closed with the usual knotted sutures.\n\nRESULTS: Dural closure was performed 65-340 minutes (mean: 161.9 minutes) post-durotomy. This technique resulted in primary dural closure with a sufficient area of preserved dura in all but one patient. In this patient, the dura shrank due to coagulation of the dural attachment to the meningioma for which a small autologous substitute was required. There were no procedure-related complications such as cerebrospinal fluid leakage and meningitis.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Dural moisturizing with fibrin glue coating is simple, protects the dura from drying and shrinkage, and facilitates primary dural closure in patients undergoing the lateral suboccipital approach.",

We describe a technique where the brain surface is covered with a protective layer of fibrin glue and discuss its advantages.\n\nMETHODS: A thin layer of fibrin glue was applied on the brain surface after its exposure in 34 patients who underwent different craniotomies for tumoral and vascular lesions. Data of 35 more patients who underwent standard microsurgical technique were collected as a control group. Cortical and pial injuries were evaluated using an intraoperative visual scale. Eventual abnormal signals at the early postoperative T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (T2FLAIR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences were evaluated in oncological patients.\n\nRESULTS: Total pial injury was noted in 63% of cases where fibrin glue was not used. In cases where fibrin glue was applied, a significantly lower percentage of 26% (P < 0.01) had pial injuries. Only 9% had injuries in areas covered with fibrin glue (P < 0.0001). Early postoperative T2FLAIR MRI confirmed the differences of altered signal around the surgical field in the two populations.\n\nCONCLUSION: We propose beside an appropriate and careful microsurgical technique the possible use of fibrin glue as alternative, safe, and helpful protection during complex microsurgical dissections. Its intrinsic features allow the neurosurgeon to minimize the cortical manipulation preventing minor collateral brain injury.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

In the randomized, phase III FINISH-3 study, Raplixa plus gelatin sponge was superior to gelatin sponge alone in reducing the time to haemostasis in adults who developed mild or moderate bleeding uncontrolled by conventional surgical techniques while undergoing spinal, vascular, hepatic or soft-tissue surgical procedures. Raplixa was well tolerated, with a similar safety profile to that observed in the gelatin-sponge-alone group.

We conducted an animal study to compare RADA16-I with fibrin sealant, a commonly used agent, with the hypothesis that the former would be a comparable alternative. Using a standardized surgical brain injury model, 30 Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into three treatment groups: RADA16-I, fibrin sealant or gelatin sponge (control). Animals were sacrificed on day 3 and 42. Astrocytic and microglial infiltrations within the cerebral parenchyma adjacent to the operative site were significantly lower in the RADA16-I and fibrin sealant groups than control. RADA16-I did not cause more cellular inflammatory response despite its acidity when compared with fibrin sealant. Immunohistochemical studies showed infiltration by astrocytes and microglia into the fibrin sealant and RADA16-I grafts, suggesting their potential uses as tissue scaffolds. RADA16-I is a promising candidate for further translational and clinical studies that focus on its applications as a safe and effective hemostat, proregenerative nanofiber scaffold as well as drug and cell carrier.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

We describe our technique to close cortical defects by the aid of a fibrin adhesive and subsequent Ringer inflation with the aim to avoid cortical mantle collapse and to prevent the development of subdural fluid collections.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We report the preliminary results of a prospective study on a consecutive series of 29 children who underwent 37 transcortical or transcallosal surgical procedures since 2008 in our department.\n\nRESULTS: In 17 procedures, we performed a transcortical approach on lesions, and in other 19 operations, we operated by a transcallosal. In 5/17 transcortical approaches (29%) and in 3/20 transcallosal approaches (15%), we observed a 5-mm-thick subdural fluid collection of the 5 patients with subdural fluid collections in the transcortical group, 3 patients (17%) underwent surgery for symptomatic or progressive subdural fluid collections. Of the 3 patients in the transcallosal group, a subduro-peritoneal shunt was necessary only for 1 patient (5%). At the very end of the treatment (including chemotherapy and radiotherapy), it was possible to remove the subduro-peritoneal shunt in all these patients because of disappearance of the subdural fluid collections.\n\nCONCLUSION: In pediatric patients after transcortical or transcallosal procedures, the use of a fibrin adhesive to seal surgical opening and subsequent inflation of the residual cavity with Ringer lactate solution to avoid cortical mantle collapse seems safe and appears to prevent the development of subdural fluid collections.",

A total of 126 adult patients were randomized (Fibrocaps: n = 47 [FC-002 US], n = 39 [FC-002 NL]; gelatin sponge alone: n = 23 [FC-002 US], n = 17 [FC-002 NL). One bleeding site was treated during a surgical procedure (n = 125). Time to hemostasis (primary end point) was measured, with a 28-d safety follow-up. Four surgical indications included hepatic resection (n = 58), spinal procedures (n = 37), peripheral vascular procedures (n = 30), and soft tissue dissection (n = 1).\n\nRESULTS: Mean (standard deviation) time to hemostasis was significantly shorter after Fibrocaps treatment than after gelatin sponge alone (FC-002 US: 1.9 [1.3] versus 4.8 min [3.1], P < 0.001; FC-002 NL: 2.2 [1.3] versus 4.4 min [3.1], P = 0.004).

Adverse events were consistent with surgical procedures performed and patients' underlying diseases and generally similar between treatment arms; most were mild or moderate in severity.

FN function was evaluated preoperatively and at 18 months using the House-Brackmann (HB) grading system.\n\nRESULTS: Among the 595 patients operated for CPA schwannomas in this period, 15 patients (2.5%) underwent FN repair, including 7 cases of FNS and 8 cases of VS. Tumor removal was total in all cases. FN recovery was HB3 in 13 cases (86.7%) and HB4 in 2. The mean time to the first clinical signs of facial reinnervation was 10 months (6-12 mo). No significant relation was found between postoperative facial function and tumor size or type, even if all cases of preoperative FP were noted in FNS.\n\nCONCLUSION: Immediate FN reconstruction with fibrin glue-aided greater auricular nerve graft can effectively restore FN function with excellent outcomes. The results seem better than those observed by other authors using sutured grafts or delayed hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis.",

We used a rat durotomy model to test the usefulness of a new gelatin glue as a dural sealant in a rat model of transdural CSF leakage. All rats were randomly divided into one of the following three treatment groups: no application (control group: N = 18), application of fibrin glue (fibrin glue group: N = 18), and application of the new gelatin glue (new gelatin glue group: N = 18). The craniotomy side was re-opened, and CSF leakage was checked and recorded at 1, 7, and 28 days postoperatively. The new gelatin glue was adequate for stopping CSF leakage; no leakage was observed at postoperative days 1 or 7, and leakage was observed in only one rat at postoperative day 28. This result was statistically significant when compared to the control group (P = 0.002, P = 0.015, P = 0.015, respectively). The pathologic score of the new gelatin group was not different from that of the control or fibrin glue groups. We conclude that our new gelatin glue provides effective watertight closure 1, 7, and 28 days after operation in the rat durotomy model.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: To date, fibrin sealant is considered to be one of the most effective substitutes to prevent post-operative fibrosis and to limit neuroma formation after nerve suture. Because fibrin sealant presents a number of drawbacks, more suitable techniques should be considered. The aim of this study was to functionally and histologically compare the efficiency of a fibrin sealant to a resorbable semi-permeable porcine type I collagen membrane after a peroneal nerve lesion and repair on rats.\n\nMETHODS: Rats were divided into four groups: (1) a SHAM group (n=10) in which surgery was performed without damaging the nerve, (2) a LESION group (n=15) in which the nerve was cut and immediately sutured without additional treatment, (3) a MEMBRANE group (n=30) in which a collagen membrane was wrapped around the lesion site, and (4) a GLUE group (n=30) in which the peroneal nerve was coated by fibrin sealant. Peroneal Functional Index (PFI), kinematic analysis of locomotion, muscular atrophy, axonal regrowth, and irritant ranking score (IRS) were performed during three months post-surgery.\n\nRESULTS: Our results indicate that at the third month post-surgery, no difference in both the functional recovery and the histological measurement was observed between groups. However, no deleterious effect was observed following the use of the collagen membrane. Indeed, the porcine membrane was well-integrated into the host tissue, with no noticeable foreign body reaction at three months post-surgery.\n\nCONCLUSION: Our preliminary results highlight the fact that the collagen membrane could be used as an alternative to fibrin sealant in peripheral nerve repair surgery. Indeed, animals in which the collagen membrane was used to wrap the lesion site exhibited similar functional and histological results as animals in which a fibrin sealant was used to coat the lesion. The greatest advantage of this membrane is that it could be used as a drug delivery device, regulated by its degradation rate.",

Several of etiologies exist, including surgical dural violations, lumbar puncture, or spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leak. Current management includes conservative management consisting of bed rest, caffeine, and hydration. When conservative management fails, open surgical or percutaneous options are considered. Currently, the gold standard in percutaneous management of intracranial hypotension involves the epidural injection of autologous blood. Recently, some therapies for intracranial hypotension have employed the use of epidural fibrin glue.\n\nCASE PRESENTATION: Two cases of patients with persistent postdural puncture headaches are presented. Epidural fibrin glue injection alleviated the orthostatic headaches of two patients with intracranial hypotension.\n\nCONCLUSION: Although consideration must be afforded for the potential risks of viral transmission and aseptic meningitis, the utilization of epidural fibrin glue injection as an alternative or adjunct to the epidural blood patch in the treatment of intracranial hypotension should be further investigated.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To compare the success in repair of dural tears (DTs) using two different surgical sealants in non-instrumented lumbar spinal surgery and evaluate the incidence of associated short- and long-term complications.\n\nMETHODS: Twenty-three patients undergoing non-instrumented spinal surgery with intraoperative DTs were included both retrospectively and prospectively in this study. External signs of CSF leakage, neurological deficits, and infection-related complications were investigated postoperatively. The persistence of low-back pain was also evaluated and postoperative MRI was performed in all patients. DTs were repaired intraoperatively using suture with or without a dural patch. Eleven patients received an application of fibrin glue (Tissucol(); Baxter, Inc., IL, USA) and 12 patients received an application of bovine serum albumin glutaraldehyde surgical adhesive (BioGlue() Surgical Adhesive; CryoLife, GA, USA). These patients were followed up at 3 months and 1 year postoperatively.\n\nRESULTS: Successful intraoperative DT repair was obtained in all cases. Three patients in the Tissucol group presented with CSF leakage in the early postoperative period. There were no complications observed in the patients treated with BioGlue. At 3-month follow-up, no incidences of neurological or infection-related complications were observed in either group. There was no statistically significant difference in VAS between the two treatment groups.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative DTs can be easily repaired by many effective techniques. However, in our experience, the use of BioGlue is an effective adjunct to immediate dural repair, being comparable in terms of efficacy and safety to the use of fibrin glue, potentially decreasing the incidence of associated short- and long-term complications.",

    "abstract": "OBJECT: Several materials, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) hydrogel and fibrin glue, have been used to seal dural incisions after brain and spinal surgeries. Although the use of PEG sealant is gaining popularity, it can be associated with postoperative cerebrospinal fluid leakage and infection. However, the reasons for this association are currently unknown. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of PEG sealant and fibrin glue on wound healing and brain damage in vivo.\n\nMETHODS: Oval-shaped bone defects and dural defects were created bilaterally over the parietal lobes of 22 Japanese white rabbits. The dural defects were covered with 0.5 ml of fibrin glue on one side and 0.5 ml of PEG sealant on the other side. Dural regeneration and brain damage were investigated in each harvested brain and dura mater using light microscopy.\n\nRESULTS: Dural regeneration was more effective in the presence of fibrin glue than it was with PEG sealant (p = 0.014). Of the 22 rabbits, 11 showed thick (Grades ++ and +++) dural regeneration by 28 days postsurgery in the hemisphere where fibrin glue was used, whereas Grade +++ dural regeneration was not observed in the PEG hydrogel hemisphere, and only 4 rabbits showed Grade ++ regeneration. Abscess and granulation formation also tended to be more severe when PEG hydrogel sealant was used. No Grade ++ granulation/abscess formation was observed with fibrin glue, and Grade + was only observed in 13 of 22 rabbits. Conversely, with PEG hydrogel sealant, only 2 rabbits did not show granulation/abscess formation, and Grade +, ++, and +++ granulation/abscess formation was observed in 8, 7, and 5 rabbits, respectively. The extent of cortical damage was significantly greater in rabbits with abscesses and granulations, compared with rabbits without these lesions (p = 0.007).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Dural regeneration tended to occur more rapidly with fibrin glue, whereas granulation was more likely with PEG hydrogel sealant, which led to postoperative complications. Histological analysis indicated that PEG hydrogel sealant inhibited the normal tissue healing process and that outcomes were improved by the use of fibrin glue.",

As surgical advancements progress, minimally invasive neurosurgical procedures are increasing in the pediatric population with reported benefits of decreased blood loss and need for transfusion, shorter hospital stay, decreased cost, lower morbidity, and mortality. In addition, there is a heightened emphasis on achieving hemostasis, which has led to the use of products such as antifibrinolytics and fibrin sealants. We present a case where a VAE causing significant hemodynamic instability (grade III) ensued immediately following aerosolized fibrin sealant application. Exploration of the potential source of VAE pointed to the high pressure and close proximity (between spray device and tissue) during application of the sealant, likely forcing air into the vascular system.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ventral root avulsion is an experimental model of proximal axonal injury at the central/peripheral nervous system interface that results in paralysis and poor clinical outcome after restorative surgery. Root reimplantation may decrease neuronal degeneration in such cases. We describe the use of a snake venom-derived fibrin sealant during surgical reconnection of avulsed roots at the spinal cord surface. The present work investigates the effects of this fibrin sealant on functional recovery, neuronal survival, synaptic plasticity, and glial reaction in the spinal motoneuron microenvironment after ventral root reimplantation.\n\nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Female Lewis rats (7 weeks old) were subjected to VRA and root replantation. The animals were divided into two groups: 1) avulsion only and 2) replanted roots with fibrin sealant derived from snake venom. Post-surgical motor performance was evaluated using the CatWalk system twice a week for 12 weeks. The rats were sacrificed 12 weeks after surgery, and their lumbar intumescences were processed for motoneuron counting and immunohistochemistry (GFAP, Iba-1 and synaptophysin antisera). Array based qRT-PCR was used to evaluate gene regulation of several neurotrophic factors and receptors as well as inflammatory related molecules. The results indicated that the root reimplantation with fibrin sealant enhanced motor recovery, preserved the synaptic covering of the motoneurons and improved neuronal survival. The replanted group did not show significant changes in microglial response compared to VRA-only. However, the astroglial reaction was significantly reduced in this group.\n\nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In conclusion, the present data suggest that the repair of avulsed roots with snake venom fibrin glue at the exact point of detachment results in neuroprotection and preservation of the synaptic network at the microenvironment of the lesioned motoneurons. Also such procedure reduced the astroglial reaction and increased mRNA levels to neurotrophins and anti-inflammatory cytokines that may in turn, contribute to improving recovery of motor function.",

The objective of this study was to use an animal model for orthopaedic implant infection to examine the ability of a new-generation fibrin tissue sealant to effectively deliver antibiotics to the surgical site.\n\nMETHODS: The antibiotics cefazolin, fusidic acid or 5-fluorouracil were blended into Vitagel tissue sealant. The release rate of the drugs was measured using HPLC methods and bioactivity was measured by the zone of inhibition method with pathogenic Staphylococcus aureus. The antibiotic activity of the drug-loaded sealant was then tested in rats using infected orthopaedic surgical sites (titanium clip on spine). Efficacy was evaluated by residual bacterial counts on clips, clinical observations of infection, and histological findings.\n\nRESULTS: The drugs were released in a controlled manner over 2-4 days. All three antibiotics demonstrated strong antibacterial activity when released from the sealants. None of the treated animals demonstrated systemic illness. Post mortem dissection revealed a well-encapsulated abscess surrounding the titanium clip with erosion of the bony process. Using an inoculum of 1-5 x 10(3) CFU, treatment with antibiotic-loaded fibrin sealant demonstrated reduced infective swelling and reduced bacterial counts on surgical clip swabs compared to control rats or rats treated with antibiotic only. This model allowed for almost 100 % infectivity with a 0 % mortality rate due to infection, mimicking the clinical features of human implant infection.\n\nCONCLUSION: The results support the use of antibiotic-loaded commercially available fibrin sealants to prevent infection after implant surgery.",

We propose a fast technique using oxidized cellulose and fibrin glue to achieve firm and watertight closure of minor dural defects in supratentorial cranial surgery.\n\nTECHNICAL NOTE: Oxidized cellulose is cut to the shape of the dural defect and applied as an onlay graft. Fibrin sealant is then applied over the cellulose and the dural margins defect. The web conformation of oxidized cellulose avoids adhesion of fibrin glue to the underlying cortical surface of the brain. This technique has been applied in 45 of 467 supratentorial craniotomies during two consecutive years. The procedure was performed in few seconds. Postoperatively, three patients developed subgaleal fluid collection, which resolved conservatively in two cases. There were no other complications or reoperations.\n\nCONCLUSION: We used a piece of oxidized cellulose, reinforced by fibrin glue, as a sutureless graft with more ease and less technical demand than other techniques. The reported technique is a fast and valid alternative to small dural defect closure methods.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

    "abstract": "OBJECT: Posterior fossa decompression with duraplasty for Chiari malformation Type I (CM-I) is a common pediatric neurosurgery procedure. Published series report a complication rate ranging from 3% to 40% for this procedure. Historically, many dural substitutes have been used, including bovine grafts, human cadaveric pericardium, synthetic dura, and autologous pericranium. The authors hypothesized that a recently observed increase in complications was dependent on the graft used.\n\nMETHODS: Between January 2004 and January 2008, 114 consecutive patients <= 18 years old underwent primary CM-I decompression using duraplasty. Records were retrospectively reviewed for short- and intermediate-term complications and operative technique, focusing on the choice of duraplasty graft with or without application of a tissue sealant.\n\nRESULTS: The average age of the patients was 8.6 years. The dural graft used was variable: 15 were treated with cadaveric pericardium, 12 with Durepair, and 87 with EnDura. Tisseel was used in 75 patients, DuraSeal in 12, and no tissue sealant was used in 27 patients. The overall complication rate was 21.1%. The most common complications included aseptic meningitis, symptomatic pseudomeningocele, or a CSF leak requiring reoperation. The overall complication rates were as follows: cadaveric pericardium 26.7%, Durepair 41.7%, and EnDura 17.2%; reoperation rates were 13%, 25%, and 8.1%, respectively. Prior to adopting a different graft product, the overall complication rate was 18.1%; following the change the rate increased to 35%. Complication rates for tissue sealants were 14.8% for no sealant, 18.7% for Tisseel, and 50% for DuraSeal. Nine patients were treated with the combination of Durepair and DuraSeal and this subgroup had a 56% complication rate.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Complication rates after CM-I decompression may be dependent on the dural graft with or without the addition of tissue sealant. The complication rate at the authors' institution approximately doubled following the adoption of a different graft product. Tissue sealants used in combination with a dural substitute to augment a duraplasty may increase the risk of aseptic meningitis and/or CSF leak. The mechanism of the apparent increased inflammation with this combination remains under investigation.",

The mean patient age was 36.5 +/- 15.33 (mean +/- SD) years, and the male/female ratio was 3:1. The mean time from injury to treatment was 25.7 +/- 26.58 months, and the cause of injury included motor vehicle accident (26 patients [43.3%]), fall from a height (17 patients [28.3%]), sports (4 patients [6.7%]), and other (13 patients [21.7%]). Application of aFGF with fibrin glue and duraplasty was performed via laminectomy, and an adjuvant booster of combined aFGF and fibrin glue (2 ml) was given at 3 and 6 months postsurgery via lumbar puncture. Outcome measurements included the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) motor scores, sensory scores, impairment scales, and neurological levels. Examination of functional independence measures, visual analog scale, MR imaging, electrophysiological and urodynamic studies, hematology and biochemistry tests, tumor markers, and serum inflammatory cytokines were all conducted. All adverse events were monitored and reported. Exclusions were based on refusal, unrelated adverse events, or failure to participate in the planned rehabilitation.\n\nRESULTS: Forty-nine patients (26 with cervical and 23 with thoracolumbar injuries) completed the 24-month trial. Compared with preoperative conditions, the 24-month postoperative ASIA motor scores improved significantly in the cervical group (from 27.6 +/- 15.55 to 37.0 +/- 19.93, p < 0.001) and thoracolumbar group (from 56.8 +/- 9.21 to 60.7 +/- 10.10, p < 0.001). The ASIA sensory scores also demonstrated significant improvement in light touch and pinprick in both groups: from 55.8 +/- 24.89 to 59.8 +/- 26.47 (p = 0.049) and 56.3 +/- 23.36 to 62.3 +/- 24.87 (p = 0.003), respectively, in the cervical group and from 75.7 +/- 15.65 to 79.2 +/- 15.81 (p < 0.001) and 78.2 +/- 14.72 to 82.7 +/- 16.60 (p < 0.001), respectively, in the thoracolumbar group. At 24-month follow-up, the ASIA impairment scale improved significantly in both groups (30% cervical [p = 0.011] and 30% thoracolumbar [p = 0.003]). There was also significant improvement in neurological level in the cervical (from 5.17 +/- 1.60 to 6.27 +/- 3.27, p = 0.022) and thoracolumbar (from 18.03 +/- 4.19 to 18.67 +/- 3.96, p = 0.001) groups. The average sum of motor items in functional independence measure also had significant improvement in both groups (p < 0.05). The walking/wheelchair locomotion subscale showed increased percentages of patients who were ambulatory (from 3.4% to 13.8% and from 17.9% to 35.7% in the cervical and thoracolumbar groups, respectively). There were no related adverse events.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The use of aFGF for spinal cord injury was safe and feasible in the present trial. There were significant improvements in ASIA motor and sensory scale scores, ASIA impairment scales, neurological levels, and functional independence measure at 24 months after treatment. Further large-scale, randomized, and controlled investigations are warranted to evaluate the efficacy and long-term results.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Post-operative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks are a common complication of endoscopic pituitary surgery and account for a significant proportion of hospital costs associated with this procedure. Tisseel is a tissue glue commonly used as an adjunct in dural repair but is not optimal for this purpose. DuraSeal has several properties advantageous for dural repair but is not widely accepted in Canada partly due to its increased cost.\n\nOBJECTIVE: A cost analysis of DuraSeal versus Tisseel in endoscopic pituitary surgery.\n\nMETHODS: A cost analysis was performed based on typical endoscopic pituitary surgery cases performed at our tertiary care institution. Operating room, hospital admission, and surgical sealant costs were obtained directly while estimates of patient recovery time and post-operative CSF leak rates were based on consensus values reported in the literature. Outcomes were reported for various possible clinical scenarios of sealant use.\n\nRESULTS: In a model where surgical sealant is employed only in high-risk cases, use of DuraSeal allows for a yearly cost savings of at least $4486.72. If surgical sealant is used in all cases, regular use of DuraSeal versus Tisseel either marginally reduces yearly costs or increases them by a maximum of $7619.25, depending on the case volume and estimated post-operative CSF leak rate.\n\nCONCLUSION: In most clinical scenarios, use of DuraSeal in endoscopic pituitary surgery may reduce overall yearly hospital costs compared to Tisseel.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to report our experience and illustrate our technique in the use of fibrin glue in the treatment of post-operatory cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks and collections following different neurosurgical procedures.\n\nMETHODS: In a 3-year period, 40 subjects underwent endoscopic endonasal approach for different sellar and skull base lesions (three tuberculum sellae meningiomas, six craniopharyngiomas, three Rathke's cleft cysts and 28 pituitary macroadenomas), in which an intraoperative CSF leakage was evident. In such subjects, the fibrin glue was used as a first step of the final phase of the procedure-i.e. the reconstruction of the skull base defect-followed by the other materials employed. Furthermore, ten other patients, who had undergone transsphenoidal (four cases), spinal (two cases), posterior fossa (three cases) and transcortical intraventricular tumour removal (one case) neurosurgical procedures and developed CSF leaks or collections, were conservatively treated by single or repeated in situ injections of \"modified\" fibrin glue under local anaesthesia according to different described techniques. In total, 50 patients constitute the clinical material of the present study.\n\nTECHNIQUE: In the cases where the fibrin glue was used during the reconstruction phase of the procedure (40 cases), the glue was injected inside the tumour cavity to fill the dead space left by the removal of the lesion. In case of post-operative CSF leak or CSF fluid collection (ten cases), after discarding 50-80% of the thrombin solution to obtain prevalence of the product's adhesive properties, fibrin glue was injected directly in the path of the CSF leak or into the collection cavity after aspiration of the collection's content. This was performed with the provided application system or through lumbar or Tuohy needles. Applications were repeated every 48 h until the disappearance of the leak. In all the treated cases, the disappearance of CSF leaks or collections was obtained with a number of applications ranging from one to five. Successful results are stable with a follow-up ranging from 6 months to 3 years.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: In our experience, the injection of fibrin glue has proved to be effective in filling or sealing post-operative \"dead spaces\" and treating minor or initial CSF leaks resulting from procedures of transsphenoidal, cranial and spinal surgery, adding another possibility in the management of many of these dreadful complications.",

In this study, we assess the effectiveness and safety of fibrin sealant supplemented with tributyrin, termed Medicated Adhesion Barrier (MAB), as an alternative means of reducing the incidence of posterior spinal epidural adhesion formation. Laminectomy defects in sheep were treated with MAB, fibrin sealant alone, ADCONGel, or remained untreated. At 12 weeks postoperatively, the extent of fibrosis and epidural adhesion formation was evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), peel-off testing, and histological examination. Initial invitro analysis revealed that tributyrin was retained in fibrin gel in a time-dependent manner and was an effective inhibitor of fibroblast proliferation. Treatment of sheep with MAB significantly reduced both the prevalence (p < 0.05) and tenacity (p < 0.05) of epidural adhesions. The effectiveness of MAB in preventing epidural adhesions was found to be comparable with that of ADCONGel. No adverse events were reported after the use of MAB. The MAB preparation seems to be an effective resorbable barrier for the prevention of epidural adhesions.",

In the last 5 months of the period studied, fibrin glue (Tisseel) was used and six out of the 16 patients had their wound closure assisted by this means. Data was prospectively collected on age at surgery, the estimated peri-operative blood loss, the volume of blood transfused intra-operatively, the volume drained in the first 8 h post-operatively, the total post-operative drainage and the volume of any post-operative blood transfusion required.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The two groups were comparable with a similar mean age at surgery, estimated peri-operative blood loss and intra-operative blood transfusion requirements. The volume drained in the first 8 h post-operatively was 172 ml in the treated group compared to 246 ml in the untreated group (p < 0.02) and the total post-operative drain volume was 301 ml compared to 441 ml (p < 0.01). None out of the six patients treated with fibrin glue required post-operative transfusion compared to two out of ten in the untreated group. The use of fibrin glue has enabled us to reduce post-operative bleeding and the need for post-operative blood transfusion.",

    "abstract": "Approximately one million spinal surgeries are performed in the United States each year. The risk of an incidental durotomy (ID) and resultant persistent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage is a significant concern for surgeons, as this complication has been associated with increased length of hospitalization, worse neurological outcome, and the development of CSF fistulae. Augmentation of standard dural suture repair with the application of fibrin glue has been suggested to reduce the frequency of these complications. This study examined unintended durotomies during lumbar spine surgery in a large surgical patient cohort and the impact of fibrin glue usage as part of the ID repair on the incidence of persistent CSF leakage. A retrospective analysis of 4,835 surgical procedures of the lumbar spine from a single institution over a 10-year period was performed to determine the rate of ID. The 90-day clinical course of these patients was evaluated. Clinical examination, B-2 transferrin assay, and radiographic imaging were utilized to determine the number of persistent CSF leaks after repair with or without fibrin glue. Five hundred forty-seven patients (11.3%) experienced a durotomy during surgery. Of this cohort, fibrin glue was used in the dural repair in 278 patients (50.8%). Logistic models evaluating age, sex, redo surgery, and the use of fibrin glue revealed that prior lumbar spinal surgery was the only univariate predictor of persistent CSF leak, conferring a 2.8-fold increase in risk. A persistent CSF leak, defined as continued drainage of CSF from the operative incision within 90 days of the surgery that required an intervention greater than simple bed rest or over-sewing of the wound, was noted in a total of 64 patients (11.7%). This persistent CSF leak rate was significantly higher (P < 0.001) in patients with prior lumbar surgery (21%) versus those undergoing their first spine surgery (9%). There was no statistical difference in persistent CSF leak between those cases in which fibrin glue was used at the time of surgery and those in which fibrin glue was not used. There were no complications associated with the use of fibrin glue. A history of prior surgery significantly increases the incidence of durotomy during elective lumbar spine surgery. In patients who experienced a durotomy during lumbar spine surgery, the use of fibrin glue for dural repair did not significantly decrease the incidence of a persistent CSF leak.",

Follow-up averaged 30 months. Postoperative evaluations included serial photographs, repeated physical examination, and three-dimensional computed tomography scan.\n\nRESULTS: High-fibrin concentration of the platelet glue allowed easy molding and sculpting of the scaffold, providing mechanical stability and avoiding spillage of the granules into the operating field. Neither infection of the surgical site nor extrusion of the scaffold was noted. The contour of the reconstructed calvarium was esthetically acceptable, without any secondary depression. Three-dimensional computed tomography scans 2 years after surgery revealed satisfactory reconstruction of the bone defect. Visual inspection of the reconstructed calvarium 2 years after surgery in one patient evidenced conversion of the scaffold into solid new bone. Section of the biopsy demonstrated new bone formation at the expense of the scaffold.\n\nCONCLUSION: Combining an osteoconductive scaffold with platelet glue offers an interesting alternative to autogenous bone graft or methyl methacrylate for posttraumatic calvarium bone defect reconstruction.",

Although fibrin sealants are commonly used for hemostasis, no studies have been published on the efficacy of these products in achieving hemostasis after anterior cervical surgery.\n\nMETHODS: A retrospective age-, gender-, and fusion level-matched pair analysis was performed on 30 pairs of patients who underwent anterior cervical fusion >or= 3 levels. In the study group, after adequate hemostasis was obtained, before wound closure 2.0 mL of fibrin sealant was applied as a fine aerosolized spray over and around the plate/fusion sites and the soft tissues to seal the main operative field. A deep drain was used in all patients. Total drain output, time for the drainage to decrease to <or=20 mL per 8 hours shift, LOS, and number of readmissions were determined and analyzed by experienced and independent spine surgeons.\n\nRESULTS: Total drain output averaged 47 mL in the study group and 98 mL in the control group (P < 0.0001). Time for the drainage to decrease to <or=20 mL per shift averaged 17 hours (range, 8-29 hours) in the study group and 24 hours (range, 7-43 hours) in the control group (P = 0.0054). LOS averaged 1.2 days (range, 1-4 days) in the study group and 2.1 day (range, 1-5 days) in the control group (P < 0.0001). Two patients were readmitted within 4 days of discharge in each group because of swallowing difficulty, dyspnea, or pneumonia (P = 1.000). There were no adverse reactions attributable to the fibrin sealant.\n\nCONCLUSION: Application of fibrin sealant at the end of multilevel anterior cervical fusion can significantly decrease postoperative drain output and LOS.",

However, continuous venous oozing that occurs during cavernous sinus surgery can cause significant blood loss and poor visualization. We describe a technique that will help minimize cavernous sinus bleeding and improve the safety of the surgical steps.\n\nMETHODS: The lateral wall of the cavernous sinus is exposed. Cavernous sinus access windows between the V1 and V2 branches of the trigeminal nerve and posterior to the clinoidal internal carotid artery are used to inject fibrin glue into the different cavernous sinus compartments. Postoperative follow-up cerebral angiography in basilar apex aneurysms clipped using the transcavernous approach were evaluated for cavernous sinus patency during the venous phase.\n\nRESULTS: Fibrin glue injection between V1 and V2 obliterated the lateral cavernous sinus compartment. Fibrin glue injection posterior to the clinoidal segment of the internal carotid artery obliterated the medial compartment of the cavernous sinus. These steps were used in 217 surgical procedures (95 benign and 9 malignant neoplastic lesions; 113 aneurysms). There were no significant clinical side effects. Follow-up angiographic controls of basilar aneurysms operated on via the transcavernous approach consistently showed the reestablishment of flow within the cavernous sinus as early as 2 to 3 months postoperatively.\n\nCONCLUSION: Presently, the use of hemostatic agents and the better understanding of the microsurgical anatomy of the cranial base and cavernous sinus enable us to tame the cavernous sinus and operate in and around it with a high degree of safety.",

    "abstract": "Brain tumors such as glioblastoma reappear in their original location in almost 50% of cases. To prevent this recurrence, we developed a radiopharmaceutical system that consists of a gel applied immediately after surgical resection of a brain tumor to deliver local radiation booster doses. The gel, which strongly adheres to tissue in the treatment area, consists of fibrin glue containing the beta-emitters rhenium-188 and rhenium-186 in microsphere-bound form. Such microspheres can be prepared by short (2 h or less) neutron activation even in low neutron flux reactors, yielding a mixture of the two beta-emitters rhenium-188 (E(max)=2.1 MeV, half life=17 h) and rhenium-186 (E(max)=1.1 MeV, half life=90.6h). The dosimetry of this rhenium-188/rhenium-186 fibrin glue system was determined using gafchromic film measurements. The treatment efficacy of the radioactive fibrin glue was measured in a 9L-glioblastoma rat model. All animals receiving the non-radioactive fibrin glue died within 17+/-3 days, whereas 60% of the treated animals survived 36 days, the final length of the experiment. Control animals that were treated with the same amount of radioactive fibrin glue, but had not received a previous tumor cell injection, showed no toxic effects over one year. The beta-radiation emitting rhenium-188/rhenium-186-based gel thus provides an effective method of delivering high doses of local radiation to tumor tissue, particularly to wet areas where high adhesive strength and long-term radiation (with or without drug) delivery are needed.",

Numerous methods to prevent postoperative CSF leakage are available, but pressure-tight dural closure remains difficult, especially with synthetic surgical membranes. The efficacy of a novel dural closure technique was assessed by detecting extradural or subcutaneous CSF leakage on magnetic resonance imaging.\n\nMETHODS: The novel dural closure technique using absorbable polyglactin acid sheet and fibrin glue and the conventional procedure using only fibrin glue were evaluated retrospectively by identifying extradural or subcutaneous CSF leakage on magnetic resonance imaging scans in the acute (2-7 d) and chronic (3-6 mo) postoperative stages after spinal intradural surgery in 53 patients.\n\nRESULTS: The incidence of extradural and subcutaneous CSF leakage was significantly lower (P < 0.05) in the acute (20%) and chronic (0%) stages using polyglactin acid sheet and fibrin glue in 15 patients compared with that in the acute (81%) and chronic (24%) stages using only fibrin glue in 38 patients.

The aim of the present study was to develop an alternative coating material for cerebral aneurysm, which is safe, effective and stable within the brain. In the first experiment, an aneurysm model of the common carotid artery was produced in a rabbit by the local application of elastase. The aneurysm produced was covered by no material (Group A), a cellulose cotton sheet and conventional methyl-2-cyanoacrylate (Group B), a newly produced polyglycolic acid felt and fibrin glue (Group C), or a cellulose cotton sheet and fibrin glue (Group D). Histological examination showed that the materials resulted in the formation of tight connective tissue around the artery, and that the material was completely replaced by the connective tissue after 12 weeks. This change was found exclusively in Group C, but not in Group A or the other materials, although a temporary thickening of the intima was also observed at the site of the elastase application in Group C. In Group D, a long-term, marked thickening of the intima was observed. In the second experiment, using an intracranial internal carotid artery from a beagle, the applied polyglycolic acid felt and fibrin glue to the intracranial artery induced the formation of connective tissue around the artery that was completely absorbed 16 weeks after surgery. There were no signs of intimal thickening or of adverse reactions in nervous tissue. The present results suggest that polyglycolic acid felt and fibrin glue is a possible candidate for a safe, effective biomaterial to wrap or coat cerebral aneurysm.",

Repaired rats recovered both motor-evoked potentials recorded at the lumbar level and locomotor function. Cord retransection rostral to the repair abolished the recovery, indicating improvement was due to long tract regeneration. To determine which long tracts correlated with recovery, a novel technique of simultaneous bidirectional axonal tracing and immunohistochemical examination of axonal type was used to quantitate the regeneration of corticospinal, rubrospinal, reticulospinal, vestibulospinal, raphespinal, propriospinal, serotonergic, and calcitonin gene-related peptide containing axons. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed recovery of function correlated only with regeneration of corticospinal axons into the gray matter of the lumbar spinal cord (R = 0.977, p < 0.02). For the first time, we show that regeneration of the corticospinal tract into the lumbar gray matter is a mechanism of functional locomotor recovery after complete cord transection and repair.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the functional outcome of facial nerve repair with fibrin glue in end-to-end anastomosis and intermediate nerve graft. Thirty-six patients undergoing facial nerve repair by end-to-end anastomosis or facial nerve grafting using exclusively fibrin glue between 1986 and 1999 were included in this retrospective study. The population comprised ten vestibular schwannomas (28%), nine temporal bone fractures (25%), seven facial nerve schwannomas (19%), four facial nerve hemangiomas (11%), two iatrogenic facial nerve interruptions (6%) and four miscellaneous facial nerve lesions (11%). Data were reviewed concerning etiology, location of the nerve interruption, type of repair and postoperative facial function according to the repaired facial nerve recovery scale (A: normal; B: independent movements of eyelid and mouth; C: strong closure of eyelids and mouth; D: incomplete eyelid closure; E: minimal movement; F: no movement). Eleven patients (31%) underwent end-to-end nerve anastomosis and 25 (69%) underwent intermediate facial nerve grafting. The mean follow-up period was 50 months (range: 3-95). Among patients followed-up more than 18 months (n = 20), a score of B or C was obtained in 16 patients (80%), a score D in 2 cases (10%) and a score E in 2 cases (10%). The type of repair and the site of interruption did not influence the results. Fibrin glue is a simple, rapid and efficient means of facial nerve repair. In case of intraoperative facial nerve interruption, this type of repair can be attempted in any location at the time of the tumor removal.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine, in patients undergoing sellar repair after endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal surgery, the clinical efficacy of a combination of fibrin sealant/collagen fleece compared to the use of fibrin sealant or collagen fleece alone, in preventing CSF-related (cerebrospinal fluid) postoperative complications.\n\nMETHODS: From a retrospective analysis of our series of 242 consecutive endoscopic transsphenoidal procedures, in 56 out of the 90 cases in which the sella had been repaired, fibrin sealant and/or collagen fleece was employed, both in combination with one or multiple layers of other materials. The incidence of postoperative CSF leaks and the need for a postoperative lumbar drainage in the groups of fibrin sealant or collagen fleece treated patients were compared to the group of patients treated with the fibrin sealant/collagen fleece combination.\n\nRESULTS: In 2 out of 16 fibrin sealant treated patients a postoperative CSF leak presented, and in 6 out of these 16 subjects a postoperative lumbar drainage was necessary; patients who received a fibrin sealant/collagen fleece combination exhibited no detectable postoperative CSF leak, and no postoperative lumbar drainage was used.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Closure of the sella turcica with fibrin sealant in combination with a collagen fleece is a safe and effective method to prevent CSF fistulas. When used in combination, the collagen fleece enhances the sealing and tissue regeneration properties of the fibrin sealant, thus reducing the incidence of postoperative CSF leaks, obviating the need for a lumbar drain placement.",

    "abstract": "Spontaneous intracranial hypotension due to a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak in the spine is an important cause of new, daily persistent headaches. Most patients respond well to conservative treatments including epidural blood patching. Limited options for effective treatment are available for patients in whom these treatments fail. The authors treated four patients (mean age 38 years; range 26-43 years) with percutaneous placement of a fibrin sealant. All these patients presented with intractable positional headaches. The CSF leak was located in the lower cervical spine in three patients and in the lower thoracic spine in one patient. Four to 20 milliliters of fibrin sealant was injected at the site of the CSF leak. Two of the four patients became asymptomatic within days of the procedure and thus avoided surgery. There were no complications of this procedure. Percutaneous placement of a fibrin sealant is a safe, minimally invasive treatment for spontaneous spinal CSF leaks and should be considered in patients in whom conservative treatment has failed.",

    "abstract": "Malignant gliomas tend to recur in the vast majority of cases. Recurrent gliomas may arise from vital tumor cells present in this zone around the resection margin. It appears promising to combine tumor resection with local chemotherapy using an antineoplastic, but non-toxic agent. Taurolidine exerts a selective antineoplastic effect by induction of programmed cell death and has anti-angiogenic activity. Fibrin sealant is completely degradable and firmly adheres to brain tissue, suggesting that it would provide a suitable matrix for taurolidine delivery--a Taurolidine-Fibrin-Sealant-Matrix (TFM)--in the local treatment of brain tumors. The potential of local delivery of taurolidine out of a fibrin sealant matrix was investigated. Taurolidine could be suspended homogeneously in both the thrombin and the procoagulant protein components of the fibrin sealant. The fibrin sealant matrix was a suitable carrier for the suspension of taurolidine at a concentration that ensured the release of therapeutically effective amounts of the drug over a period of 2 weeks in vitro. The antineoplastic action of taurolidine was not affected by embedding in the fibrin sealant matrix. The described drug delivery system may be suitable for local taurolidine treatment of brain tumors following complete or partial resection or of tumors that are non-resectable because of their location.",

    "abstract": "For many years, neurosurgeons and otolaryngologic surgeons have used the fibrin glue product Tisseel to repair skull-base spinal fluid leaks and to help secure repairs following anterior cranial-base surgery. Despite the widespread use, the potential focal cerebral toxicity of this fibrin glue has never been investigated. We studied the safety of Tisseel applied directly to neural tissue (brain parenchyma, cervical cord, and C3-C6 spinal roots) of 6 monkeys (Macaca nemestrina) to determine if any underlying biochemical injury would occur. Another 3 animals that served as controls received saline rather than Tisseel. We found that median nerve electroencephalographic tracings and somatosensory evoked potentials in the experimental and control animals were identical. Likewise, cerebrospinal fluid indicators of neuronal or brain injury, inflammatory responses, and infection were negative in both groups. Finally, there were no significant differences between the two groups with respect to edema volumes and apparent diffusion coefficient values. We conclude that Tisseel does not induce an apparent inflammatory response or abnormal neurophysiologic or histologic response within 5 days of its application when it is applied directly to the brain parenchyma or onto the cervical spinal cord.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Post-operative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) fistula following neurosurgery is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. This prospective study evaluates the efficacy of a new bioadhesive--BioGlue, as a dural sealant in preventing CSF fistula. The complications associated with its use are investigated and the literature regarding dural closure reviewed.\n\nMETHODS: BioGlue was applied to the dura mater as a sealant in 210 patients undergoing 216 neurosurgical procedures over a period of 22 months at the Royal Melbourne Hospital. It was used where watertight closure of the dura mater could not be ensured by primary suture alone and for reconstruction of the sellar floor following transsphenoidal adenohypophysectomy. It was used in 114 supratentorial (52.7%), 53 infratentorial (24.5%) craniotomies, 41 (18.9%) transsphenoidal adenohypophysectomies and 8 spinal (3.7%) procedures. The incidence of CSF fistula as a complication of surgery with intradural exposure was analysed.\n\nRESULTS: The incidence of CSF fistula post-operatively was significantly low. Two patients (0.93%), both having undergone posterior fossa craniotomy--for evacuation of a cerebellar haematoma and redo excision of a metastasis respectively and both complicated by hydrocephalus, developed CSF fistula. There were no complications associated with the use of BioGlue.\n\nCONCLUSION: BioGlue reduced the incidence of complications associated with neurosurgery. It is an effective adjunct in dural closure to prevent CSF fistula with enhanced bonding properties and is simple to use. In this study there were no complications associated with its use.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical efficacy and cost effectiveness of using the fibrin sealant (FS) Tisseel (Baxter Healthcare Corp., Deerfield, IL) for patients undergoing anterior cranial base, infratemporal, and retromastoid surgical procedures.\n\nMETHODS: A retrospective review was performed, comparing two matched populations of patients who underwent surgical procedures using anterior cranial, infratemporal, or retromastoid approaches to intracranial pathological lesions. The incidences of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks in matched groups treated with the FS Tisseel or treated without FS were compared. The costs of Tisseel use were examined in comparison with the costs of postoperative management of CSF leaks and/or tension pneumocranium with spinal drainage and occasionally surgical reexploration, when lumbar drainage failed.\n\nRESULTS: Patients who received the FS Tisseel exhibited no detectable postoperative CSF leaks or tension pneumocranium. Patients who did not receive Tisseel demonstrated 4 to 16% incidences of postoperative leaks, depending on the surgical approach used. The costs of treating those leaks far exceeded the costs of using Tisseel, even if it were used indiscriminately for all patients.\n\nCONCLUSION: This retrospective review indicates that the FS Tisseel reduces the incidence of postoperative CSF leaks and tension pneumocranium while reducing overall management costs. Further prospective study is needed to determine which patients can benefit most from FS use.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Little is known of the histologic effects of fibrin glue on normal nervous tissue. To verify the safety of intracranial application of fibrin glue, we investigated the histologic effects of fibrin glue on brain tissue and intracranial nerves of rats.\n\nMETHODS: In Group I (n = 12), bifrontal craniotomy with opening of the dura and arachnoid was performed, and on one side one droplet of fibrin glue was applied into the subarachnoid space. In Group II (n = 12), a unilateral temporal craniotomy was performed, the cavernous sinus was opened, and one drop of fibrin glue was applied to the trigeminal nerve. The controls for Group II (n = 8) were operated in the same way but without application of the fibrin glue. Rats were sacrificed at 1, 3, 7, and 28 days after surgery. The brains and nerves were processed for histologic examination and were semi-quantitatively scored for neuronal damage, gliosis, edema, fibroplasia, inflammatory reaction, axonal damage, and myelin damage.\n\nRESULTS: No differences were found in the occurrence of neuronal damage, gliosis, edema, fibroplasia, axonal damage, or myelin damage between rats with and without fibrin glue application. In Group I the inflammatory reaction seen at Day 7 was more severe on the fibrin glue side when compared to the control side. At Day 28, however, this difference had resolved.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: In this morphological safety study, intracranial application of fibrin glue in a rat model does not induce extra brain damage, intracranial nerve damage, or scar tissue formation.",
